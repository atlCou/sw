 galw.1.d:0 "Gallian researchers have spent the years since the last neuroi war designing and testing new concepts for a weapon developed specifically for witches. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. They're new and rudimentary, but at least now we have a specialized defense mechanism for when they inevitably attack again.\n\nAlthough we have a small number of witches already in our air force who can be assigned these units, we have just barely a reasonable amount of witches within Gallia available for military purposes. Perhaps improving our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense."

Though their desires for a nationalistic, traditionalistic, and illiberal republic are not what Chriss Keera and her large cabal had in mind; they undoubtly hold more support with the general public.\nHowever, the Gallian Loyalists have proven to be fully dedicated to their cause.\n\nOnly one group would walk out victorious."

GAL_1936elections:0 "1936 Elections"
GAL_1936elections_desc:0 "Gallian elections are held every four years, and have generally remain split between left wing and moderate right wing parties. 1936 is rumored to be a potentially special year for Gallia, with socialist parties and factions having a stronger edge than ever before, even within the broad left-wing Parti socialiste."
GAL_unitedgallia:0 "United Gallia"
GAL_unitedgallia_desc:0 "The Gallian future is one of both prosperity for every Gallian worker, and a state of perpetual war with the Neuroi. The ultimate meaning of being Gallian, from the time of the Romans to the Bonapartes, has been to find freedom in warfare. The Neuroi will come to know Gallia, and our entire populace will be free from the degeneracies of capitalism that we have wrongfull embraced for years."
GAL_workersgallia:0 "Worker's Gallia"
GAL_workersgallia_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent step for the people of both Gallia and the world, but in order to progress into the future we must leave behind one of the most important fascets of our century old ideals - that of capitalistic markets. A more democratic economic system, one in which economic structures are socially owned, will put Gallia again at the head of social progress."
GAL_statusquo:0 "Centrist Victory"
GAL_statusquo_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent step for the people of both Gallia and the world, and we see little need to change that. The socialist reformists fail to see the capability of our current structure to solve their economic concerns, but we believe genuinely that the democratic and a regulated market-based system is unlike any other in the past or future."
GAL_socdem_victory:0 "Parti socialiste Victory"
GAL_socdem_victory_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent rallying point for democratic ideals throughout its history, and this election proved no different. The moderates in the leading center-left Gallian party have won the majority of the French vote, surpassing the right in the vote and the socialists in the public opinion."

GAL_gallia:0 "Gallia!"
GAL_gallia_desc:0 "And with this final stroke of power politics, the fate of Gallia will be decided. Will Gallia return to the royal monarchy of old, hard-set on recreating a Gallian dominated Europe, or will Gallia look to its national culture and march into the future?"

GAL_nous_voila:0 "Nous Voilà!"
GAL_nous_voila_desc:0 "All the able bodied Gallians must fight for their bretheren under the Karlslander yoke. Maréchal Lemare calls for their support, and we'll make full sure that they answer that call with joy and enthusiasm."
GAL_no_socialists:0 "No Socialists!"	
GAL_no_socialists_desc:0 "The Gallian socialists were a pervasive force, but they above all else threaten our new republican state. The unionists will be placated with our own means of negotation, but the worst of the movements will crumble when we remove their foundations."
GAL_no_liberals:0 "No Liberals!"
GAL_no_liberals_desc:0 "The liberals may have created the first republican state, but they could not forsee the decadency and weakness it resulted in. Besides, we're sure Robespierre would stand by our side had he been here 150 years later."
GAL_no_monarchists:0 "And No Monarchists!"
GAL_no_monarchists_desc:0 "Chris Keera and her intelligence associates may have lead the coup, but they don't hold any recognition of patriotism or of the future. A republic cannot survive with loyalist thorns in its side."

GAL_reorganize_the_unions:0 "State Mediated Bargaining"
GAL_reorganize_the_unions_desc:0 "Trade Unions serve the existence of socialist thought and sabotage the productivity of our factories. Instead, the state shall act as a negotiator of labour disputes. We'll be impartial."
GAL_a_corporatist_state:0 "Conseil National Des Corporations"
GAL_a_corporatist_state_desc:0 "The National Council of Corporations shall serve as a great national body, serving as the economic organ of our state's entire body. All negotations will act in accordance with the decisions of the council, and Lemare's desires will be enforced through the council as the mind does to an arm and hand."

GAL_monarchie:0 "Monarchie"
GAL_monarchie_desc:0 "The Gallian monarchy of old was a force unparalled on European soil. The nobility cultivated beautiful and holy art forms, and we stood as a bulwark of the Romagnan-Jupitonian Church. Karlsland has lost its way since unification, and the geographic blots of that age have grown corrupt and stagnant."
GAL_burn_the_docs:0 "Burn the Documents"
GAL_burn_the_docs_desc:0 "The documents, especially the constitution, of the Gallian republic would serve as nothing more than propaganda for republicans. We must burn them as a statement and practicality."
GAL_no_socialist_unions:0 "Ban Socialist Unions"
GAL_no_socialist_unions_desc:0 "What purposes to unions serve? Certainly not the interests of Gallia's best. The worst offenders are those which wish to overthrow our birthright. This cannot stand."
GAL_mon_witch:0 "A New Witch"
GAL_mon_witch_desc:0 "It's no secret that the public love the air infantry, and it's commonplace for governments around the world to prop up their best aces at symbols of their government. But for too long has Gallia promoted liberal, republican witches that have tainted the essence of Gallia. The monarchy will support only those witches that represent the refined, noble values of the new Kingdom of Gallia."
GAL_centralize_military:0 "Centralize the Military"
GAL_centralize_military_desc:0 "The great Gallian absolutists centralized the military under their rule, which made it the most effective fighting force in Europe. In principle, this should still work today. The Karlslanders may assume benefit in the autonomy of their officers, but we will see it in the loyalty of our soldiers."
GAL_economic_reactionism:0 "Economic Reactionism"
GAL_economic_reactionism_desc:0 "Though absolutists would organize the economy under themselves, this type of organization simply doesn't work in a world as dynamic as ours. Unfortunately, we must take some inspiration from the liberals and delegate some economic tasks to the non-noble Gallian bourgeois. They will be made subserviant by other means."
GAL_funding_the_arts:0 "Funding the Arts"
GAL_funding_the_arts_desc:0 "The arts are one of Gallia's greatest assets. Political theorists since the Renaissance have emphasized how important it is for leaders to be loved by their people - and we can do this by helping one of the most radical factions. That is, as long as those funds aren't used for decadent and dangerous works."
GAL_supporting_service:0 "Our Loyal Secret Forces"
GAL_supporting_service_desc:0 "Our intelligence services got us here, and they should be praised for it. We will bolster the remaining royalists' program into the King's own secret police, allowing them to crack down on liberal resistance."
GAL_cracking_down:0 "Cracking Down Again"

The Orussian regime was founded on nothing but lust for power, and its peoples have suffered under that backwards noble rule for too long. We will do what the liberal Gallian emperor of a century ago couldn't do, and cement our Gallia in the permanent stream of human history!"
