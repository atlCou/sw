 galw.1.d:0 "Gallian researchers have spent the years since the last neuroi war designing and testing new concepts for a weapon developed specifically for witches. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. They're new and rudimentary, but at least now we have a specialized defense mechanism for when they inevitably attack again.\n\nAlthough we have a small number of witches already in our air force who can be assigned these units, we have just barely a reasonable amount of witches within Gallia available for military purposes. Perhaps improving our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense."

Though their desires for a nationalistic, traditionalistic, and illiberal republic are not what Chriss Keera and her large cabal had in mind; they undoubtly hold more support with the general public.\nHowever, the Gallian Loyalists have proven to be fully dedicated to their cause.\n\nOnly one group would walk out victorious."

GAL_1936elections_desc:0 "Gallian elections are held every four years, and have generally remain split between left wing and moderate right wing parties. 1936 is rumored to be a potentially special year for Gallia, with socialist parties and factions having a stronger edge than ever before, even within the broad left-wing Parti socialiste."

GAL_workersgallia_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent step for the people of both Gallia and the world, but in order to progress into the future we must leave behind one of the most important fascets of our century old ideals - that of capitalistic markets. A more democratic economic system, one in which economic structures are socially owned, will put Gallia again at the head of social progress."

GAL_no_socialists:0 "No Socialists!"	
GAL_no_socialists_desc:0 "The Gallian socialists were a pervasive force, but they above all else threaten our new republican state. The unionists will be placated with our own means of negotation, but the worst of the movements will crumble when we remove their foundations."
GAL_no_liberals:0 "No Liberals!"
GAL_no_liberals_desc:0 "The liberals may have created the first republican state, but they could not forsee the decadency and weakness it resulted in. Besides, we're sure Robespierre would stand by our side had he been here 150 years later."
GAL_no_monarchists:0 "And No Monarchists!"

GAL_a_corporatist_state_desc:0 "The National Council of Corporations shall serve as a great national body, serving as the economic organ of our state's entire body.

GAL_monarchie:0 "Monarchie"
GAL_monarchie_desc:0 "The Gallian monarchy of old was a force unparalled on European soil. The nobility cultivated beautiful and holy art forms, and we stood as a bulwark of the Romagnan-Jupitonian Church. Karlsland has lost its way since unification, and the geographic blots of that age have grown corrupt and stagnant."

GAL_mon_witch_desc:0 "It's no secret that the public love the air infantry, and it's commonplace for governments around the world to prop up their best aces at symbols of their government. But for too long has Gallia promoted liberal, republican witches that have tainted the essence of Gallia. The monarchy will support only those witches that represent the refined, noble values of the new Kingdom of Gallia."
GAL_centralize_military:0 "Centralize the Military"
GAL_centralize_military_desc:0 "The great Gallian absolutists centralized the military under their rule, which made it the most effective fighting force in Europe. In principle, this should still work today. The Karlslanders may assume benefit in the autonomy of their officers, but we will see it in the loyalty of our soldiers."
GAL_economic_reactionism:0 "Economic Reactionism"
GAL_economic_reactionism_desc:0 "Though absolutists would organize the economy under themselves, this type of organization simply doesn't work in a world as dynamic as ours. Unfortunately, we must take some inspiration from the liberals and delegate some economic tasks to the non-noble Gallian bourgeois. They will be made subserviant by other means."
GAL_funding_the_arts:0 "Funding the Arts"
GAL_funding_the_arts_desc:0 "The arts are one of Gallia's greatest assets. Political theorists since the Renaissance have emphasized how important it is for leaders to be loved by their people - and we can do this by helping one of the most radical factions. That is, as long as those funds aren't used for decadent and dangerous works."
GAL_supporting_service:0 "Our Loyal Secret Forces"

GAL_nationalist_league_desc:0 "There are many other nations in Europe squabbling to become the greatest they can be, to acheive heights they once had before but that nations like Karlsland have cheated and backstabbed them out of. If we unite with them, we'll be stronger together."
GAL_formalizing_the_alliance:0 "Formalizing the League"

GAL_claim_the_rhine_desc:0 "A border on the Rhine!

GAL_romagnan_invitation:0 "Romagnan Invitation"
GAL_romagnan_invitation_desc:0 "Romagna is the ultimate center of Gallia's religious and moral pathway, even if we refuse to let them leverage political control over our people. But Romagna's hold to tradition has opened up an opportunity - maybe they would like to join us on a sort-of crusade agains the Karlslanders. Like old time sake?"
GAL_romagnan_intervention:0 "Romagnan Intervention"
GAL_romagnan_intervention_desc:0 "Romagna, unfortunately, has been lost. A flank on the alps is not the most dangerous thing, but we may want to keep check on them in case they try to pull anything nasty. Maybe we could put off a conflict with Karlsland to show them the light of the gods and order again..."
GAL_just_alsace:0 "Just Alsace"
GAL_just_alsace_desc:0 "What are we, a bunch of children drawing lines on maps? What we want from Karlsland is Alsace - our people. What was taken from us in a liberal war and what we will take back in an orderly, just one. What are we but populists with a desire for order if were to claim anything more?"
GAL_geopolitical_reorganization:0 "Geopolitical Reorganization"
GAL_geopolitical_reorganization_desc:0 "We are strong, Karlsland is weak. The Low Countries are in our grasp, and the reins of the future are in our hands. Gallia was once the center of a very great empire, and the interest of many more. We will redraw the maps and cleanse governments to revert not only the actions of degenerate liberals, but of every damn subversive ruler from the beginning of our history books."
GAL_karlslander_demands:0 "Karlslander Demands"
GAL_karlslander_demands_desc:0 "It's time Karlsland heard our demands. They can give us what we claim or they can face complete defeat - we didn't get here for nothing, after all."

GAL_no_onions_for_ostmarkers:0 "No Onions for Ostmarkers"
GAL_no_onions_for_ostmarkers_desc:0 "The Danubian basin is a place of rot and deceit, of people robbed of good rule and of economic stagnation. They're also our historic enemies since the Romagnanization of Gallia. So there's that, too."
GAL_historic_claims:0 "Historic Claims"

GAL_karlslander_actually:0 "Finish The Beast"

GAL_free_the_east:0 "Free The East"
GAL_free_the_east_desc:0 "We've beaten the Karlslanders and Ostmarkers, but to the east lays the worst offender of them all. The Orussian regime was founded on nothing but lust for power, and its peoples have suffered under that backwards noble rule for too long. We will do what the liberal Gallian emperor of a century ago couldn't do, and cement our Gallia in the permanent stream of human history!"

 gallia.1.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
 gallia.1.d:0 "As the elections approach, Gallia sees itself in internal political distraught. The liberal Gallian government republic to respond to growing calls from laborers to grant more strength to unions has caused not only SGIO to regain tremendous popularity after decades of Gallian conservatism, but the more revolutionary socialist factions to find themselves with unprecedented levels of popularity.\n\nIn an odd step away from principles, the PCG also plans on running on their standard revolutionary platform, referred to as a "non-violent" revolution in case of their victory. However, many party members fear Gallia's intelligence community, which is known by some to have their own agenda. There is no sentiment that the intelligence community would cooperate with such a government."

 gallia.3.d:0 "As the Gallian elections quickly approach, the center-right democratic party and moderate wing of the PS have also began to increase their public advocation. Although their rhetoric and their ideology is the same as always, many find comfort in the large presence of anti-socialist and pro-liberal rhetoric."

 gallia.5.d:0 "Though it seemed like the socialists would hold an absolute majority, the PCG has began a last-minute mass radicalization campaign. To many, who had simply been ignorant of the party, the PCG seemed much more attractive. In fear of splitting the vote and letting the liberals form a government again, the two parties met to discuss terms:"

 gallia.6.t:0 "PCG Mobilizes!"
 gallia.6.d:0 "To ensure a victory, and to potentially get in a little bit of revolution-ing in before they win the vote, the PCG had members march through major cities to rally support. For a few hours, it would've been impossible for any Parisian businessman to walk to a cafe on his lunch break."
