 galw.1.d:0 "Gallian researchers have spent the years since the last neuroi war designing and testing new concepts for a weapon developed specifically for witches. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. They're new and rudimentary, but at least now we have a specialized defense mechanism for when they inevitably attack again.\n\nAlthough we have a small number of witches already in our air force who can be assigned these units, we have just barely a reasonable amount of witches within Gallia available for military purposes. Perhaps improving our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense."

GAL_1936elections:0 "1936 Elections"
GAL_1936elections_desc:0 "Gallian elections are held every four years, and have generally remain split anywhere between left wing and moderate right wing parties. 1936 is set to be an especially dangerous year for Gallia, with radical socialist parties having a stronger edge than ever before. The Intelligence Services are rumoured plagued with radicals of some sort, but the civil government has been unable to properly root them out."
GAL_PS_victory:0 "§RPS Victory§!"

GAL_RS_victory:0 "RS Victory"
GAL_RS_victory_desc:0 "The Radical-Socialist Party has come out on top after the 1936 elections! Despite their rather extreme name in Britannic, they were largely seen as the moderate choice. The fate of Gallia are in its hands."
GAL_PR_victory:0 "§YPR Victory§!"
GAL_PR_victory_desc:0 "The Republican Party has come out victorious again after the 1936 elections! As extreme elements fight all around Gallia, the fate of Gallia are in its very liberal hands."

GAL_unity_as_a_priority_desc:0 "With extremists almost literally all around our party, we should make sure that even vaguely like-minded parties are on our side in the legislature, to prevent unnecessary conflict in the government and on the streets."
GAL_a_wobbly_government:0 "A Wobbly Government"
GAL_a_wobbly_government_desc:0 "The Gallian government, once again, is in a state of disarry. We must ensure that it does not fall, so that the rights afforded by the Gallian government are not taken away from the Gallian people."

GAL_placate_intel_serv:0 "Placate the Intelligence Services"
GAL_placate_intel_serv_desc:0 "The intelligence services are disgustingly corrupt and plagued with political extremists. Although counter-intuitive, it may do us well to readjust funding so that the definitively neutral parts of the service can remain loyal to the republic, and hope that the extremists drop out back into the shadows."
GAL_RW_concessions:0 "Right-Wing Concessions"
GAL_RW_concessions_desc:0 "The Right-Wing parties may not have stood a chance to win the last election, but they still make up a significant part of the legislature. As a display of our willingness to compromise, we can give up ground on less important social issues to stabalize conservative agitators."
GAL_further_industrial_regulations:0 "Further Industrial Regulations"
GAL_further_industrial_regulations_desc:0 "Socialism need not be acheived through revolution, but through gradual and electoral means. By squeezing industrial conglomerates, we can improve the lives of workers and get a little bit closer to a democratic economy."

GAL_living_up_to_our_platform_desc:0 "Socialist is in our name, and eventually our supporters are going to want to see us live up to that.

GAL_loyal_to_the_republic:0 "Loyal to the Republic"
GAL_loyal_to_the_republic_desc:0 "The Gallian Republic is an international hallmark of liberalism and freedom. Although it has been notoriously unstable in the past, we have finally pulled through the worst and are back on track to restoring the greatness of the Gallian Republic!"
GAL_the_crisis_act:0 "The Crisis Act"
GAL_the_crisis_act_desc:0 "Extreme danger calls for extreme measures. Socialistic strikes have been plagueing Gallia for years, and causing economic and political instability. To save Gallian institutions and freedoms, we must ban all striking - temporarily, of course."

GAL_reverse_the_prog_tax: "Reverse the Progressive Tax"
GAL_reverse_the_prog_tax_desc:0 "The steep progressive tax levied by the RS government 6 years ago has been a pain on our back since the 1932 election. With even more legitimacy, we can finally repeal it in favor of a flatter, and more fair, tax."

GAL_wrangling_the_crisis_act_tooltip:0 "§YGallia§! will §Gcommit§! to §Cprotecting the bourgeois§!."
GAL_wrangling_the_crisis_act_desc:0 "This has gone too far. Members of the legal Socialist Party are still striking, and members in government are openly calling for nationalization and complete socialism. Enough! These extremely radical revolutionaries should not be allowed to destabilize the Gallian government - it was insane that we ever did at all."
GAL_uniting_our_wing:0 "Uniting Our Wing"
GAL_uniting_our_wing_desc:0 "Though we don't like to see ourselves as part of the right-wing, the fact is that we're leaving out an entire third of the legislature and the Gallian populace by ignoring them. Let us unite in distaste for these socialist revolutionaries, and unite in our love for Gallian freedom."
GAL_the_mil_if_we_have_to:0 "Using The Military, if We Have To"
GAL_the_mil_if_we_have_to_desc:0 "It will leave an awful taste in our mouth's, but it's time we really squashed out the striking. What kind of state allows subversive revolutionaries to demonstrate in public? If we have to, we'll send the military in to crush the strikes - the tanks should scare them off for good."
GAL_the_paternal_state:0 "The Paternal Democracy"
GAL_the_paternal_state_desc:0 "Finally, the Gallian Republic can be molded into the secure democracy it always should have been. We had blissfully ignored the teachings of the 1799 coup and the Liberion Federalists; that a state, even democratic, cannot allow open subversion. The Gallian Republic can now be truly free and strong!"
GAL_a_new_com_of_pub_safety:0 "A New Committee of Public Safety!"
GAL_a_new_com_of_pub_safety_desc:0 "Our legal election has blessed us with an opportunity to go back to the Jacobin ideal! Let the legislature act as a new Committee of Public Safety, which will overhear crimes of economic injustice and raise up the Gallian worker with revolutionary zeal."

GAL_root_out_the_traitors_desc:0 "Word has it that the intelligence services are ridden with political extremists who wish to see a restoration of the old monarchy. Insane. Unthinkable. Why do we allow these subversives to control the intelligence services of our country?! Root them out!"
GAL_mass_nationalization:0 "Mass Nationalization"
GAL_mass_nationalization_desc:0 "It's not enough to give your workers higher wages or give them shorter hours. The workers shouldn't need to negotiate for these things - their compensation should be inherent in their ownership of the production facilities themselves. Thus, we will begin to seize all modes of industry, to distribute them to the workers as it should be."
GAL_absorb_RS:0 "Absorb the Radical-Socialist Party"
GAL_absorb_RS_desc:0 "The Radical-Socialist party has no reason to exist outside of subversion anymore. The loyal members of the Radical-Socialist party should find solace in our newly expanded party platform, and if they don't, then they're no different from the liberals and the nationalists."
GAL_a_new_gallia:0 "And A New Gallia!"
GAL_a_new_gallia_desc:0 "From a thesis and antithesis comes the synthesis. That synthesis is this new, socialist Gallia, just as a new republican Gallia rose one and a half centuries ago from the corpse of the absolutist."

GAL_disband_intelligence_services:0 "Disband the Intelligence Services"
GAL_disband_intelligence_services_desc:0 "The intelligence services have served the state well, but they're nothing more than a nuisance now. We can now fully purge them and start over, without having to worry about a missed opportunity or negative reprucussions."
GAL_conscription_expansion:0 "Expand Conscription"
GAL_conscription_expansion_desc:0 "Gallia's working population must also be of service to the country which guides them, so implementing a more extensive conscription program must be a part of our national perogative."
GAL_invite_investors:0 "Invite More Investors to Gallia"
GAL_invite_investors_desc:0 "Though Gallia is among the most well developed nations in Europe, many investors overlook our nation in favor of more or less industrially established ones. Let's invite some investors to demonstrate the opportunity Gallia holds."
GAL_strengthen_the_government:0 "Strengthen the Government"
GAL_strengthen_the_government_desc:0 "Our government, reaching out of political chaos, has a tremendous opportunity to reassert itself and demonstrate that we can get things done. Let's do so."
GAL_further_our_industrial_base:0 "Expand our Industrial Base"
GAL_further_our_industrial_base_desc:0 "A country's industrial base is the defining measure of its strength. Gallia, almost infamously, lags behind Karlsland in this respect. With some clever legislation, and well-timed state action, we can work to reverse this as Karlsland focuses elsewhere."
GAL_socialists_worldwide:0 "Socialists Worldwide"
GAL_socialists_worldwide_desc:0 "We must not forget that we live in a world of other nations, with their own struggling workers and their own socialist movements. With this in mind, we can recognize the need for a formal organization which can safeguard these movements and liberate nations which need it the most."
GAL_socialists_worldwide_tooltip:0 "§YSOC-INT§! is the §gAI§!'s §Gpreferred socialist faction§! if formed."
GAL_the_trailing_terror:0 "The Trailing Terror"
GAL_the_trailing_terror_desc:0 "As the social and economic hierarchies rearrange and dissolve themselves, more and more Gallians openly embrace their newfound freedoms. Only a few reactionaries still reject communal ownership and legitimate political and financial freedom, who can be brought over in terrifyingly quick time."
GAL_diplomatic_neutrality:0 "Diplomatic Neutrality"
GAL_diplomatic_neutrality_desc:0 "War may bring some industries profit, but it also destroys nations. We can profit off of selling arms without being at war ourselves - we have no good reason to join military alliances if we are strong enough ourselves. It's time we pursued true neutrality and ended millennia of mistakes."
GAL_construction_contracts:0 "Construction Contracts"
GAL_construction_contracts_desc:0 "We should offer contracts to construction agencies which wish to invest in Gallia. An odd type of subsidy, but if they are given as a service than we see no issue with reaping the benefits of it."
GAL_expand_welfare_programs:0 "Expand Welfare Programs"
GAL_expand_welfare_programs_desc:0 "It's not just the Gallian state which is suffering in the wake of political turmoil, but the populace too. The Gallian people deserve the benefits which only a country can provide for them, so we should show our willingness to aid them."
GAL_break_up_monopolies:0 "Break Up Monopolies"
GAL_break_up_monopolies_desc:0 "Gallia may not have a particularly nasty monopoly problem, but they exist nonetheless. Such unnatural and inherently unfair institutions can't be reasonably allowed to operate, especially if we aim to aid the Gallian people as much as possible."
GAL_redistribute_farmland:0 "Redistribute Farmland"
GAL_redistribute_farmland_desc:0 "Much of Gallia's interior is made up of vast amounts of farmland. However, many of these farms and vineyards are opperated inefficiently or are unnecessarily and unfairly large; we would do well to break them up and redistribute the land to be more efficient and reasonable."
GAL_hausmanns_legacy:0 "Haussmann's Legacy"
GAL_hausmanns_legacy_desc:0 "Haussmann may have ruined the old Paris, but our new Gallia screams for a new Paris. So let us build the new Paris which it desires, one which will be a physical testament to the glory of our new, socialist revolution!"

GAL_europes_tax_haven:0 "Europe's Tax Haven"
GAL_europes_tax_haven_desc:0 "Gallia has become an exceedingly prosperous nation, preferred by corporations and wealthy individuals all around the world for our uniquely business-friendly laws and our cold-turkey approach to neutrality. We've become somewhat of a "tax haven" for the world's wealthy - and we can really reap the benefits."
GAL_reapproach_our_allies:0 "Reapproach our Former Allies"
GAL_reapproach_our_allies_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great Neuroi War, we have drifted apart from our allies to fix ourselves. Now that Gallia has reasserted itself internally, we can reach back out to our old friends and work to rekindle the period of pan-national unity we had before."
GAL_a_mural_to_the_workers:0 "A Mural to the Workers"
GAL_a_mural_to_the_workers_desc:0 "Not just one literal mural, but a metaphorical painting of the greatness of the working class. Not to replace, but to hang alongside the great portraits of Gallia's intellectuals and leaders, demonstrating the great social and political unity we have acheived!"
GAL_the_impen_hexagon:0 "The Impenetrable Hexagon"
GAL_the_impen_hexagon_desc:0 "L'hexagone ! Now a land of unprecedented prosperity, it must be secure on all of its sides. The ocean is a natural border, but we remain woefully undefended on land - especially in the north. We will build a great line of forts across every border to prevent any army from marching into our lovely hexagon."
GAL_mutual_defense_pact:0 "Mutual Defense Pact"
GAL_mutual_defense_pact_desc:0 "With friendships rekindled, we can completely formalize our allegiance into an alliance. Any alien threat should be stopped dead in its tracks, if not cower away in fear. Hopefully, Gallia's freedom will be protected this way for a long time."
GAL_mutual_defense_pact_tooltip:0 "Nations which agreed to rekindling friendships in the previous focus will be given an event here, once taken."
GAL_claim_the_rhine_com:0 "Claiming the Rhine!"
GAL_claim_the_rhine_com_desc:0 "A border on the Rhine! A beautiful sight from the most glorious days of Gallian history, when the tricolor flew high over the marching soldiers and great soldiers marched for their freedom, against the fire of their enemies. We shall claim it again, displaying our might for all the world to see - on every map in every room and on every desk!"
GAL_1940_elections:0 "1940 Elections"
GAL_1940_elections_desc:0 "The world situation has changed, but elections will go on as the political situation has stabalized. Each party has their own platform to combat and deal with the conflict at hand, but who will come out victorious?"
GAL_total_war:0 "Guerre totale !"
GAL_total_war_desc:0 ""Je vous demande : voulez-vous la guerre totale? Si nécessaire, voulez-vous une guerre plus totale et plus radicale que ce que nous pouvons imaginer aujourd’hui?" The Neuroi didn't answer - and so total war it will get."
GAL_levy_mil-indus:0 "Levy Military Industry"
GAL_levy_mil-indus_desc:0 "Our economic strength has blessed us with a vast amount of industry which we can levy for the war effort. The populace will get exhausted after being pressed to produce much more than usual for so long - it's inevitable, they are still people - but it can and will be done."
GAL_wartime_relief:0 "Wartime Relief Packages"
GAL_wartime_relief_desc:0 "War with the Neuroi puts a unique strain on every individual. Not only do the Neuroi not care about harming civilians, they actively seek to. There is nothing that Gallia can do for its citizens that would be more beneficial than to just help them, to keep Gallians on their feet during these unprecedentedly difficult times." 
GAL_arms_buildup:0 "Arms Buildup"
GAL_arms_buildup_desc:0 "Gallia must produce more arms, and it must do so now. We can petition to rent factories or build them so that the Neuroi cannot harm them - but however we do it, we really just need to be making more guns."
GAL_further_quotas:0 "Further Quotas"
GAL_further_quotas_desc:0 "We must increase the quotas! It will be rough for the workers and administrators alike, but war is won with guns - not comfort!"
GAL_great_human_pat_war:0 "The Great Human Patriotic War"
GAL_great_human_pat_war_desc:0 "This war against the Neuroi is unlike any we had seen before. Nations wiped off maps faster than newspapers reach some towns, towns wiped off the face of the earth, and the very existence of humanity being at danger. Gallia fights for its very existence, and for the existence of humanity as a whole"
GAL_1944_elections:0 "1944 Elections"
GAL_1944_elections_desc:0 "Despite the even odder circumstances we find ourselves in, elections will go on again. Note that authoritarian parties don't hold elections and have dropped the false premise of allowing dissident parties to have a shot, unlike their predecessors." 
GAL_richest_of_the_richest:0 "Richest of the Rich"

GAL_veteran_relief_packages:0 "Veteran Relief Packages"
GAL_veteran_relief_packages_desc:0 "Veterans; soldiers, officers, witches, medics, and all the rest have all faced the worst of the worst. As many of them start to come home, we should remind them that a beautiful, open, and free Gallia is waiting for them with open arms so they can live the normal life they once dreamed of living."
GAL_the_eternal_workers_republic:0 "The Eternal Workers Republic!"
GAL_the_eternal_workers_republic_desc:0 "Even through the struggle of the unearthly, the eldritch destruction which the Neuroi have wrought over our country, the republic has survived!

GAL_keeping_the_peace:0 "Keeping the Peace"
GAL_keeping_the_peace_desc:0 "We must make sure that the democracies of Europe aren't threatened by land-hungry regimes or the beastly Neuroi if we wish to see a peaceful future. Thus, our foreign policy will be focused on forging alliances with other democracies in order to be stronger together."
GAL_spread_the_revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
GAL_spread_the_revolution_desc:0 "The original Gallian revolution did not spread throughout the world solely through the attractiveness of its ideals, but through the experiences with liberalism which its adversiaries had. To push the democracies of the world closer to a truly free ideal, we can start by freeing our neighbors from their exceptionally reactionary governments."
GAL_guar_low_countries:0 "Guaranteeing the Low Countries"
GAL_guar_low_countries_desc:0 "The Low Countries have historically been threatened by land grabby regimes from more than just Karlsland. As they are economically and culturally close to us, it'd be extremely adventageous - to the point of common sense - for us to guarantee their existence."
GAL_make_up_with_karlsland:0 "Make up with Karlsland"
GAL_make_up_with_karlsland_desc:0 "Though we have had our own, significant disagreements in the past, it is time we have accepted Karlsland as a European ally.

GAL_an_old_rivalry:0 "An Old Rivalry"
GAL_an_old_rivalry_desc:0 "Despite our best intentions, we have found Karlsland in a position unreconciable with our goals and desires for Europe. Unfortunately, our old rivarly must continue, even if we were able to act as allies in the Great Neuroi War."
GAL_free_the_belgicans:0 "Liberate the Belgicans"
GAL_free_the_belgicans_desc:0 "The Belgicans live under what is perhaps the most backwards nation in all of Europe. A corrupt nobility with stringent standards dominates the small nation, exploiting their linguistic differences and rigging elections. Enough is enough. If the Belgican people are unable to seize their freedom, then we have a duty to finally give it to them."
GAL_claim_alsace:0 "Claim Alsace"
GAL_claim_alsace_desc:0 "If Karlsland cannot be our ally, then we should be pushing for what is rightfully our's. Alsace was Gallian territory for centuries; it's time we took it back!"

GAL_my_pride:0 "My Pride..."
GAL_my_pride_desc:0 "Gallia must regain the glory it once held on the European continent. We will be prideful of our Gallia again."
GAL_my_joy:0 "My Joy..."
GAL_my_joy_desc:0 "Gallia is full of disgusting socialists, liberals, and trade-unionists. We're unpopular now, but it'll be our absolute joy to show bottom-rank Gallians their places."
GAL_gallia:0 "Gallia!"
GAL_gallia_desc:0 "And with this final stroke of power politics, the fate of Gallia will be decided. Will Gallia return to the royal monarchy of old, hard-set on recreating a Gallian dominated Europe, or will Gallia look to its national culture and march into the future?"

GAL_republique:0 "République"
GAL_republique_desc:0 "Oh, the great Gallian Republic! We may have gone astray with liberalism, but the greatest heights of French culture and patriotism were acheived under our republics. Let Maréchal Lemare lead us into a beautiful, strong, republican future!"
GAL_la_patrie_renaitra:0 "La Patrie"
GAL_la_patrie_renaitra_desc:0 "Our homeland is the source of our strength and our pride. Let us develop what we have now to regain what we have lost." 
GAL_marechal:0 "Maréchal, Maréchal"
GAL_marechal_desc:0 "Maréchal Lemare the Beautiful shall be a rallying point for all those in Gallia! The lands that we have lost will be taken back under her guidance, and all the people must know it!"
GAL_nous_voila:0 "Nous Voilà!"
GAL_nous_voila_desc:0 "All the able bodied Gallians must fight for their bretheren under the Karlslander yoke. Maréchal Lemare calls for their support, and we'll make full sure that they answer that call with joy and enthusiasm."
GAL_no_socialists:0 "No Socialists!"	
GAL_no_socialists_desc:0 "The Gallian socialists were a pervasive force, but they above all else threaten our new republican state. The unionists will be placated with our own means of negotation, but the worst of the movements will crumble when we remove their foundations."
GAL_no_liberals:0 "No Liberals!"
GAL_no_liberals_desc:0 "The liberals may have created the first republican state, but they could not forsee the decadency and weakness it resulted in. Besides, we're sure Robespierre would stand by our side had he been here 150 years later."
GAL_no_monarchists:0 "And No Monarchists!"
GAL_no_monarchists_desc:0 "Chris Keera and her intelligence associates may have lead the coup, but they don't hold any recognition of patriotism or of the future. A republic cannot survive with loyalist thorns in its side."
GAL_aux_armes:0 "Aux armes!"
GAL_aux_armes_desc:0 "How the patriotic song calls, and how the citizens must act! To arms, in the figurative and literal; that is."
GAL_reorganize_the_unions:0 "State Mediated Bargaining"
GAL_reorganize_the_unions_desc:0 "Trade Unions serve the existence of socialist thought and sabotage the productivity of our factories. Instead, the state shall act as a negotiator of labour disputes. We'll be impartial."
GAL_a_corporatist_state:0 "Conseil National Des Corporations"
GAL_a_corporatist_state_desc:0 "The National Council of Corporations shall serve as a great national body, serving as the economic organ of our state's entire body. All negotations will act in accordance with the decisions of the council, and Lemare's desires will be enforced through the council as the mind does to an arm and hand."

GAL_monarchie:0 "Monarchie"
GAL_monarchie_desc:0 "The Gallian monarchy of old was a force unparalled on European soil. The nobility cultivated beautiful and holy art forms, and we stood as a bulwark of the Romagnan-Jupitonian Church. Karlsland has lost its way since unification, and the geographic blots of that age have grown corrupt and stagnant."
GAL_burn_the_docs:0 "Burn the Documents"
GAL_burn_the_docs_desc:0 "The documents, especially the constitution, of the Gallian republic would serve as nothing more than propaganda for republicans. We must burn them as a statement and practicality."
GAL_no_socialist_unions:0 "Ban Socialist Unions"
GAL_no_socialist_unions_desc:0 "What purposes to unions serve? Certainly not the interests of Gallia's best. The worst offenders are those which wish to overthrow our birthright. This cannot stand."
GAL_mon_witch:0 "A New Witch"
GAL_mon_witch_desc:0 "It's no secret that the public love the air infantry, and it's commonplace for governments around the world to prop up their best aces at symbols of their government. But for too long has Gallia promoted liberal, republican witches that have tainted the essence of Gallia. The monarchy will support only those witches that represent the refined, noble values of the new Kingdom of Gallia."
GAL_centralize_military:0 "Centralize the Military"
GAL_centralize_military_desc:0 "The great Gallian absolutists centralized the military under their rule, which made it the most effective fighting force in Europe. In principle, this should still work today. The Karlslanders may assume benefit in the autonomy of their officers, but we will see it in the loyalty of our soldiers."
GAL_economic_reactionism:0 "Economic Reactionism"
GAL_economic_reactionism_desc:0 "Though absolutists would organize the economy under themselves, this type of organization simply doesn't work in a world as dynamic as ours. Unfortunately, we must take some inspiration from the liberals and delegate some economic tasks to the non-noble Gallian bourgeois. They will be made subserviant by other means."
GAL_funding_the_arts:0 "Funding the Arts"
GAL_funding_the_arts_desc:0 "The arts are one of Gallia's greatest assets. Political theorists since the Renaissance have emphasized how important it is for leaders to be loved by their people - and we can do this by helping one of the most radical factions. That is, as long as those funds aren't used for decadent and dangerous works."
GAL_supporting_service:0 "Our Loyal Secret Forces"
GAL_supporting_service_desc:0 "Our intelligence services got us here, and they should be praised for it. We will bolster the remaining royalists' program into the King's own secret police, allowing them to crack down on liberal resistance."
GAL_cracking_down:0 "Cracking Down Again"
GAL_cracking_down_desc:0 "With the King's secret police in order, we can begin another vast purge of liberals and socialists. For Gallia, My Pride and Joy!"

GAL_propaganda_desc:0 "The King is the State, and the State requires Alsace! All for the King, all for Alsace!"


GAL_liberte:0 "Liberté"
GAL_liberte_desc:0 "Liberty; a value so espoused by the liberal regime before us. But what of our fellow Gallians under the [KAR.GetAdjective] yolk? Alsace is Gallian, it was and it always will be - and soon we will show them that. Our Gallians will be free."
GAL_rallying_the_people:0 "Rallying the People"

GAL_war_preparations:0 "War Preparations"
GAL_war_preparations_desc:0 "Automobile factories and other light industry must be repurposed to serve the needs of the Gallian nation. They can be compensated after; maybe they'll go on to make a nice automobile for our empire."
GAL_amp_up_prop:0 "Service Propaganda"
GAL_amp_up_prop_desc:0 "Propaganda might be a good tool to keep Gallians enthusiastic, but we haven't yet ran a military campaign. Doing so may bolster the morale of our forces."

GAL_nationalist_league:0 "Nationalist League"
GAL_nationalist_league_desc:0 "There are many other nations in Europe squabbling to become the greatest they can be, to acheive heights they once had before but that nations like Karlsland have cheated and backstabbed them out of. If we unite with them, we'll be stronger together."
GAL_formalizing_the_alliance:0 "Formalizing the League"
GAL_formalizing_the_alliance_desc:0 "Right now, the League is only a defensive pact. But, if we so desire, we could expand it into a true alliance and reach before unreachable heights!"
GAL_secure_low_countries:0 "Securing the Low Countries"
GAL_secure_low_countries_desc:0 "Plans unfortunately reached us, years ago, that Karlsland had always planned to invade Belgica if war came between us. Belgica and the Netherlands have reasons to welcome our national movement with open arms - especially if it means they won't have to be invaded."
GAL_final_preparations:0 "Final Preparations"
GAL_final_preparations_desc:0 "One can never be too safe. It's been centuries since Gallia could stand up to Karlsland alone, and you never know what might be lurking in the labs of Karlsland's scientists..."
GAL_claim_the_rhine:0 "Claim the Rhine"
GAL_claim_the_rhine_desc:0 "A border on the Rhine! A beautiful sight from the most glorious days of Gallian history, when the tricolor flew high over the marching soldiers and great leaders directed Gallia headfirst into the future, against the fire of her enemies. We shall claim it again, displaying our might for all the world to see on every map!"

GAL_romagnan_invitation:0 "Romagnan Invitation"
GAL_romagnan_invitation_desc:0 "Romagna is the ultimate center of Gallia's religious and moral pathway, even if we refuse to let them leverage political control over our people. But Romagna's hold to tradition has opened up an opportunity - maybe they would like to join us on a sort-of crusade agains the Karlslanders. Like old time sake?"
GAL_romagnan_intervention:0 "Romagnan Intervention"
GAL_romagnan_intervention_desc:0 "Romagna, unfortunately, has been lost. A flank on the alps is not the most dangerous thing, but we may want to keep check on them in case they try to pull anything nasty. Maybe we could put off a conflict with Karlsland to show them the light of the gods and order again..."
GAL_just_alsace:0 "Just Alsace"
GAL_just_alsace_desc:0 "What are we, a bunch of children drawing lines on maps? What we want from Karlsland is Alsace - our people. What was taken from us in a liberal war and what we will take back in an orderly, just one. What are we but populists with a desire for order if were to claim anything more?"
GAL_geopolitical_reorganization:0 "Geopolitical Reorganization"
GAL_geopolitical_reorganization_desc:0 "We are strong, Karlsland is weak. The Low Countries are in our grasp, and the reins of the future are in our hands. Gallia was once the center of a very great empire, and the interest of many more. We will redraw the maps and cleanse governments to revert not only the actions of degenerate liberals, but of every damn subversive ruler from the beginning of our history books."
GAL_karlslander_demands:0 "Karlslander Demands"
GAL_karlslander_demands_desc:0 "It's time Karlsland heard our demands. They can give us what we claim or they can face complete defeat - we didn't get here for nothing, after all."
GAL_karlslander_demands_tooltip:0 "The demands sent to §Y[KAR.GetNameDef]§! will be determined by whether §Y[GAL.GetNameDef]§! have claimed their §Ynatural borders§! or just §YAlsace§!."
GAL_no_onions_for_ostmarkers:0 "No Onions for Ostmarkers"
GAL_no_onions_for_ostmarkers_desc:0 "The Danubian basin is a place of rot and deceit, of people robbed of good rule and of economic stagnation. They're also our historic enemies since the Romagnanization of Gallia. So there's that, too."
GAL_historic_claims:0 "Historic Claims"

GAL_karlslander_actually:0 "Finish The Beast"
GAL_karlslander_actually_desc:0 "Karlsland may have given us what we desired, but they continue their disgusting ways. It's time to march over and settle this feud, and seriously, this time."
GAL_free_the_east:0 "Free The East"
GAL_free_the_east_desc:0 "We've beaten the Karlslanders and Ostmarkers, but to the east lays the worst offender of them all. The Orussian regime was founded on nothing but lust for power, and its peoples have suffered under that backwards noble rule for too long. We will do what the liberal Gallian emperor of a century ago couldn't do, and cement our Gallia in the permanent stream of human history!"

 GAL_army_of_speed:0 "Army of Speed"
 GAL_army_of_speed_desc:0 "We should work to build the Gallian army around a philosophy of speed, as the development of practical armoured vehicles has shown great future promise."
 GAL_elite_units:0 "Elite Armoured Units"
 GAL_elite_units_desc:0 "Our armoured vehicles should be kept within specialized divisions which will allow them to be used like tips on the head of an arrow, as opposed to dispersing them throughout our army."
 GAL_a_wave_of_steel:0 "Wave of Steel"
 GAL_a_wave_of_steel_desc:0 "Our armoured vehicles should be produced in vast quantities to receive the full benefit of an armoured military. Instead of specializing on breaking frontlines in specific areas, we can make it difficult for the enemy to break us anywhere."
 GAL_emphasize_movement:0 "Emphasize Movement"
 GAL_emphasize_movement_desc:0 "As vehicles become faster, more reliable, and easier to produce, speed will continue to become more and more important for any army. Thus, we should focus on keeping the upper edge and try to make sure our's is as fast as we can reasonably get it."
 GAL_hit_harder:0 "Hit Harder"
 GAL_hit_harder_desc:0 "It's not just enough for us to be able to be faster than the enemy; we need to be able to hit them quickly, too. All the benefits of speed are lost if we waste too much time waiting and preparing before each attack."
 GAL_agile_boyes:0 "Armoured Trucks"
 GAL_agile_boyes_desc:0 "It's obviously unrealistic for us to expect Gallian engineeers to develop heavily armoured, quick trucks while they are still trying to work out the development of tanks themselves. Regardless, we can encourage the inclusion of additional armour wherever possible."
 GAL_an_armoured_mainstay:0 "An Armoured Mainstay"
 GAL_an_armoured_mainstay_desc:0 "A balance between a small, agile, but lightly armoured vehicle; and a slow, heavily armoured behemoth has been requested by officers and soldiers alike. As vehicle technology progresses, we may finally be ready to roll such a tank out."
 GAL_invest_in_radio_tech:0 "Invest in Radio Technology"
 GAL_invest_in_radio_tech_desc:0 "Radio technology is nothing new at this point, but it still has far to go. Better and more advanced communication systems will allow us to get men on the frontlines faster when they're needed; which is our name of the game."
 GAL_streamline_command_hierarchy:0 "Streamline the Command Hierarchy"
 GAL_streamline_command_hierarchy_desc:0 "With speed as a priority, a byzantine command structure makes no sense. We can clean up our command hierarchies to get the strategic to the tactical faster than before." 
 GAL_the_backbone:0 "The Backbone"
 GAL_the_backbone_desc:0 "The backbone of any military is the infantry. We need to make sure that our soldiers are able to use the most up-to-date equipment possible to ensure success and strength in the event of war."
 GAL_military_games:0 "Military Games"
 GAL_military_games_desc:0 "We can simulate military situations with various units in order to better understand the capabilities of our equipment, and predict where to dedicate time improving our strategy and technology."
 GAL_expand_our_production_base:0 "Expanding our Arms Production Capacity"
 GAL_expand_our_production_base_desc:0 "We can't rely on the good will of our allies to support ourselves in war, especially when we're a significant power in Europe ourselves. We need to make sure that we can support our military with our own production lines, so that our war effort isn't distracted by balancing diplomatic affairs."
 GAL_expand_our_knowledge_base:0 "Expanding our Knowledge Base"
 GAL_expand_our_knowledge_base_desc:0 "It's important that we can remain on-par with the world in science and technology, for both utilitarian and patriotic purposes. To help aid in this endeavor, we can redirect some wasteful military spending to fund military research facilities instead."
 GAL_wielding_our_elite_recruits:0 "Wielding our Elite Recruits"
 GAL_wielding_our_elite_recruits_desc:0 "Gallia's army has a long tradition of receiving enthusiastic volunteers, which can be of even greater use as we find more and more roles which require more extensively trained soldiers."
 GAL_an_impenetrable_defense:0 "An Impenetrable Defense"
 GAL_an_impenetrable_defense_desc:0 "First and foremost, Gallia must be able to properly defend itself against any threaet. Our quarells with the world pale in comparison to the threats we may face, and if the last Neuroi War taught us anything it's that complete loss is more devastating than any failed attack."
 GAL_from_the_skies:0 "From the Skies"
 GAL_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Advancements in airplanes have allowed us to develop vehicles which can directly aid our ground soldiers. Though this will be great to ward of threats which ill-equipped units may not be able to hold on their own, they will also prove beneficial when it's time to start a strategic counter-attack."
 GAL_from_afar:0 "From Afar"
 GAL_from_afar_desc:0 "Though brutal, the last Neuroi War taught us the importance of being able to strike enemies from where they cannot easily fire back. Artillery has advanced even more in the last two decades, and we should embrace those benefits in our army."
 GAL_expand_officer_outreach:0 "Expand Officer Outreach"
 GAL_expand_officer_outreach_desc:0 "It's important that our army has the most skilled and well trained officers possible, so that orders are given and planned as well as possible. We should expand our officer schools and promotion searches to make sure we have the best of the best."
 GAL_experts_in_holding_the_line:0 "Experts in Holding the Line"
 GAL_experts_in_holding_the_line_desc:0 "We'll put great effort into making the Gallian Army famous for its ability to hold a frontline, so that foreign threats are warded off before they even try. And, if the Neuroi come again, we'll put in as much effort as possible to make sure they go through hell to destroy Gallia again."
 GAL_modernize_our_infantry:0 "Modernize our Infantry"
 GAL_modernize_our_infantry_desc:0 "A core part of holding any frontline is the masses of infantry. Thus, it's vital that our infantry equipment is up to snuff, and, ideally, much better than our enemy's."
 GAL_advancements_in_support_bat:0 "Advancements in Support Battalions"
 GAL_advancements_in_support_bat_desc:0 "Support battalions leave a lot of room for improvement and expansion, which can greatly aid the effectiveness of the very core of our army. Thus, we should greatly consider investing into them."
 GAL_army_glory:0 "A Well Trained Core"
 GAL_army_glory_desc:0 "Our army should be focused on a well trained core, as opposed to wielding large numbers of men. It will prove more effective in keeping our production balanced with our need for reinforcements, and will mean less families have to suffer the loss of family members."
 GAL_army_size:0 "Deepen Recruitment Methods"
 GAL_army_size_desc:0 "It's important that we are able to wield a large enough army to raise a significant defense against invaders. It won't matter how well trained our army is if we are significantly outnumbered and unable to match the enemy on the frontlines. Thus, we should put an emphasis on expanding the literal size of our army."
 GAL_rebirth_of_the_gallian_army:0 "Rebirth of the Gallian Army!"
 GAL_rebirth_of_the_gallian_army_desc:0 "Our military reforms have paid off! The Gallian Army is permiated with a sense of rebirth, and feels prepared to take on any threat!\nAux armes, citoyens, formez vos bataillons, marchons, marchons !"

 ############ EVENTS ############
 
 gallia.1.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
 gallia.1.d:0 "As the elections approach, Gallia sees itself in internal political distraught. The liberal Gallian government republic to respond to growing calls from laborers to grant more strength to unions has caused not only SGIO to regain tremendous popularity after decades of Gallian conservatism, but the more revolutionary socialist factions to find themselves with unprecedented levels of popularity.\n\nIn an odd step away from principles, the PCG also plans on running on their standard revolutionary platform, referred to as a "non-violent" revolution in case of their victory. However, many party members fear Gallia's intelligence community, which is known by some to have their own agenda. There is no sentiment that the intelligence community would cooperate with such a government."
 gallia.1.a:0 "Liberté, égalité, fraternité."
 
 gallia.2.t:0 "Socialists Ramp-Up Rallies"
 gallia.2.d:0 "As the Gallian elections quickly approach, the many socialist parties and factions have begun to ramp up peaceful demonstrations across Gallia. They demand greater rights for workers and a democratization of the economic system."
 gallia.2.a:0 "Are they not part of the Gallian democratic tradition?"
 gallia.2.b:0 "Publicly condemn the left wing radicals."
 gallia.2.c:0 "In due time, comrades."
 
 gallia.3.t:0 "Moderates Ramp-Up Rallies"
 gallia.3.d:0 "As the Gallian elections quickly approach, the center-right democratic party and moderate wing of the PS have also began to increase their public advocation. Although their rhetoric and their ideology is the same as always, many find comfort in the large presence of anti-socialist and pro-liberal rhetoric."
 gallia.3.a:0 "Support the radicals."
 gallia.3.b:0 "Support the socialists."
 gallia.3.c:0 "Servants of the bourgeois..."
 
 gallia.4.t:0 "Perrine Announces the Administration's Support"
 gallia.4.d:0 "With a short amount of time until the Gallian elections begin, Perrine H. Clostermann; the de-facto representative witch for the Third Republic of Gallia, has announced she supports..."
 gallia.4.a:0 "The status quo, of course."
 gallia.4.b:0 "The socialist opposition."
 gallia.4.c:0 "No one, socialists of all kinds threaten her estate too much."
 
 gallia.5.t:0 "The Socialists in Crisis"
 gallia.5.d:0 "Though it seemed like the socialists would hold an absolute majority, the PCG has began a last-minute mass radicalization campaign. To many, who had simply been ignorant of the party, the PCG seemed much more attractive. In fear of splitting the vote and letting the liberals form a government again, the two parties met to discuss terms:"
 gallia.5.a:0 "PS is fine."
 gallia.5.b:0 "The PCG shall lead Gallia into the future!"
 
 gallia.6.t:0 "PCG Mobilizes!"
 gallia.6.d:0 "To ensure a victory, and to potentially get in a little bit of revolution-ing in before they win the vote, the PCG had members march through major cities to rally support. For a few hours, it would've been impossible for any Parisian businessman to walk to a cafe on his lunch break."
 gallia.6.a:0 "Aux armes! Or something."
 
 gallia.10.t:0 "The Elections Begin"
 gallia.10.d:0 "It's time: the Gallian elections have begun!"
 gallia.10.a:0 "Liberté, égalité, fraternité!"
 
 gallia.11.t:0 "1936 Gallian Election Results"
 gallia.11.d:0 "As the polls close, the winner of the Gallian elections appear to be..."
 gallia.11.a:0 "The Right Liberals!"
 gallia.11.b:0 "The Radical-Socialists!"
 gallia.11.c:0 "The Socialist Party!"
 gallia.11.e:0 "The Communist Party of Gallia!"
 
 
 
 gallia.20.t:0 "The Gallian Republic"
 gallia.20.d:0 "The last year was extraordinarily stressful. As workers striked, and failed terrorist plot after failed terrorist plot were uncovered by half of the Gallian intelligence services, it seems that the government finally pulled through. Without excessive violence, and without extremism, the democratic Gallian Republic has narrowly avoided a collapse.\n\nNewspapers have started to flood out reports that monarchists in the intelligence services have been arrested, and that prominent communist figures have been outed as monarchists looking to incite a reactionary revolution. Nationalistic parties have been tanking in public support as Gallians no longer worry about revolution. It seems like Gallia has finally found its footing again."
 gallia.20.a:0 "Liberté, égalité, fraternité!"
 
 gallia.30.t:0 "The Paternal Democracy"
 gallia.30.d:0 "To say that many Gallians predicted that they would lose their freedoms to a liberal government would be a lie. However, since the 1936 election, Gallians have started to feel like the walls are closing in. All parties considered left of the Radical-Socialists have been outlawed, strikes are often met with rolling tanks and platoons, and the disproportionate amount of municipalities held by right-wing parties have concerned many. But it’s too late to care.\n\nBusiness leaders can be seen entering and exiting capitol buildings at almost any time of the day, and a large amount of the budget seems to be flowing into the intelligence services uninterrupted. Vocal members of the Radical-Socialist Party are routinely seen on trial, even though their party has not been banned. Members of Parti républicain have begun to take on an oddly detached and technocratic tone, as massive subsidies are passed for industrial conglomerates that probably don’t need them. Welfare programs are passed that provide no real benefit but bring in immense amounts of revenue.\n\nBefore entering a courtroom for an unusually speedy trial, a relatively prominent Socialist Party politician remarked that, for a liberal government, this all seemed rather illiberal."
 gallia.30.a:0 "Personally, I see nothing wrong with it."

 gallia.40.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Gallia"
 gallia.40.d:0 "Blah blah blah some lore stuff i'm going to write later, make sure i actually do"
 gallia.40.a:0 "Ok"
