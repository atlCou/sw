oru.8.t:0"An Unlikely Solution"
oru.8.d:0"Tzar Nicholas the Second was seated on his chair, his head in his hands thanks to a surging migrane, as Witches raced around in barely controlled chaos. It has been like this for a while. The Commanders of the Royal Guard refused to let him out of their sight and he refused to abandon his throne for a bunker, so they settled on making the Throne-Room a War-room. Dozens of tables have been set up to roost maps and reports that change homes on a minute based schedule, the surrounding rooms, once cleaning cabinets or storage closets, have been repurposed into a communication hub with dozens of radios chirping away at milita groups across the empire. \n\nTo an outside observer this room as a text book perfect example of the controlled chaos that can be found in a Military Head Quarters. \n\nBut not the the Tzar. He knew these girls by name. He can see their fear and confusion and it sickened him to see them this way. It was when Irina Sebrova, a young witch fresh from the academy in Fuso, collasped into a panic attack that he decided he has had enough. \n\n"Enough!" He all but shouted. The room quieted instantly surprising even him."We fighting a war that can still be averted, are we not all Orussians?! You, Lieutenant! Call up General Pyotr he was a good friend of Wrangel maybe he can talk some sense into that fool and we can try to set up a meeting." He ordered. \n\n"Your Highness, we've tried to talk to him, he won't listen to us!" Alya Alelyuhin, the Commander of the Royal Guard stated. \n\n"You're right he won't listen to you. However he will listen to me." And with that Tzar Nicholas the Second of Orussia, for the first time in the very long time, made his way out of the castle to meet with an old friend. His headache gone."

oru.14.t:0"The Regent"
oru.14.d:0"Field Marshal Wrangel paced nervously in the hallway outside of the Royal Chambers internally conflicted, on one hand his request for a meeting with the Tzar was finally approved after nearly a decade. On the other he was now in Saint Petersburg, the stronghold of the Witches. He was deep in enemy territory lacking even a pistol. Not that it would be enough to overpower the two Honor Guard Tank Witches flanking the doors. \n\nAfter what felt like forever the doors opened to reveal the Tzar himself, "Leave us Lieutenant." \n\nThe witch looked shocked."But your Majesty are you su-" \n\n "I said leave us Lieutenant!" The Tzar ordered sternly. After the Tank Witches left through a side passage he turned to the Officer who has spent so long trying to meet him. "You wished to speak with me?"\n\n "Your Highness, please the Witches-" Wrangel started before being being cut off. \n\n"Are loyal Field Marshal." The Tzar stated curtly. \n\n "Please your highness they have fooled you!" Wrangel plead. \n\n "No they have not. I am not like the Emperor of the Feudal States. I am aware of what happens in my court, and what happens in my nation. I can control it, though I have chosen not to due to my failures a decade ago. That was a mistake however and I will no longer leave the throne vacant." He stated firmly. "I know you do not trust the Witches, and I know you do not trust me under their care. Allow me to place your worries at ease, you are a capable commander who was willing to go to war with his own nation to save its ruler. You are honorable as you are daring, let me prove to you the Council has no power over me and bestow upon you a gift that they would never approve of. Lord Reagent." \n\n "Your- your Highness! I am not worthy!" Wrangal stuttered.\n\n"Throughout my life I have found that those who thought themselves unworthy are far more deserving than those who believe that the position is their divine right.""

oru.15.t:0"The Umbrum Queen"
oru.15.d:0"No one knew at what time the Tzar proposed to Lady Marina Raskova, current chair of the Umbra Council, but based on the squeal of joy that could be heard ten miles away in Petergof it was around five in the afternoon. \n\nA week later, carefully timed to avoid the Ides and the Nones, the capital was filled with the sound of ringing wedding bells and Ivan's Square was filled with a cheering crowd that was only being barely held back by the combined forces of the Baltic Fleet Marines, the Saint Petersburg Garrison and the Royal Guard Tank Regiment. \n\nAll attention was on two figures being driven in an open topped car to the Shrine of Isaac. The Tzar looked understandly uncomfrotable at the attention, the last time he was on this road he was attacked by a sniper, but the women next to him looked around with star struck eyes at the gorgeous decorations and adoring people. \n\n"I thought we agreed on a small ceremony." The Tzar muttered sadly, well aware of the wave of gossip that will travel around the world through the Witch Rumor Mill."
oru.15.a:0"Well this got a bit out of hand, but, I can live with this."
