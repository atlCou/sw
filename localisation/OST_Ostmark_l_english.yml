 ############# EVENTS
 
 ostmark.200.t:0 "Regaining our Support"
 ostmark.200.d:0 "The Ostmarker empire has been thrown into disarray. The many territories that our monarchs have ruled over for centuries have risen in revolt and, in the complete incompetence of our military, successfully established their own nations. All we have left are the territories with a Karlslander majority, who themselves lack the national identity to revolt against us. The stability once afforded to them is now gone - what do we do to regain their trust?"
 ostmark.200.a:0 "Ensure them that we will lead the nation in a direction beneficial to our people."
 ostmark.200.b:0 "Crush the disenters, so that we can ensure our rule over our Karlslander people will continue."

 OST_value_from_service_desc:0 "A citizen's value is the same as the importance of their work to the Danubian State. Engineers, scientists, and soldiers gain utmost priority, as they are what will push our nation into the future and allow it to survive."
