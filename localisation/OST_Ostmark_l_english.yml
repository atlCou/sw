 ############# EVENTS
 
 
 ost.1.t:0 "Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss Missing!"
 ost.1.d:0 "In a shocking report given to the Ostmarker parliament, the executive guard has been unable to locate Engelbert Dollfuss, the conservative leader of the Grand Coalition. His charismatic figure being vacant from the building has made the announcement all the more gloomy, as politicans await for news on his finding.\nIn the meantime, it looks as if opposition parties, including the chancellor's former Heimatblock, have been protesting for snap elections. With public support for the coalition already rapidly dropping, this is an option we may have to consider."
 ost.1.a:0 "Well, then I hope we can find him!"
 ost.2.t:0 "Snap Election Vote Passes"
 ost.2.d:0 "The vote to hold a snap election passed in the parliament by a sizeable majority. It will be held in the next ten days. As usual, a ticket coalition will need to be formed, as an Ostmark without a majority government is completely ungovernable."
 ost.2.a:0 "Sounds like a lot of pressure."
 ost.3.t:0 "DL Merges with OFP"
 ost.3.d:0 "The Danubian Legionnaires, an ultra-patriotic group which champions the peoples of the general Danubian basin; and the Ostmarker Freedom Party, a party which split from the KPO for being outwardly "anti-revolutionary" and "reactionary" in nature, have decided to run together on all ballots. DL's party leader, Grete Gollob, is revered for being able to get party members out to vote - and for putting up a good fight against Heimwehr members."
 ost.3.a:0 "What a bizarre group."
 ost.4.t:0 "Meeting of the Grand Coalition Organization"
 ost.4.d:0 "As usual, the Grand Coalition Organization has invited one party group to enter a broad agreement to run on the same ticket. Traditionally, the organization chooses a generally liberal party, to balance the broad range of conservatives, moderate social democrats, and agrarians. However, some members have considered looking to the left or right at socialist and reactionary parties, including the Heimatblock and the KPO."
 ost.4.a:0 "What if we invited the KPO? They'd grant us the support of many workers."
 ost.4.b:0 "That would destabilize the coalition, instead invite the Heimatblock for patriotic voters."
 ost.4.c:0 "Isn't now a terrible time to try anything so radical?"
 ost.4.e:0 "We can run fine on our own, thank you!"
 ost.5.t:0 "The KPO!"
 ost.5.d:0 "We have invited the KPO to discuss forming a coalition. Though they would prefer revolution, many in their party look towards the Ostmarxist period over a decade ago as justification for joining with us. However, many of our right wing members claim including such radicals would destabilize the coalition, and put us at the risk of facing Heimwehr paramilitants."
 ost.5.a:0 "Maybe we should look elsewhere."
 ost.5.b:0 "We reach an agreement!"
 ost.6.t:0 "The Heimatblock!"
 ost.6.d:0 "The Heimatblock seemed joyful to join our coalition. A little too joyful, in fact. Many of our party members, regardless of affiliation, have expressed concern that doing so would give their paramilitants legal political precedent. However, some of the more extreme agrarians and conservatives have called these concerns foundless and instead cite them as an element of stability."
 ost.6.a:0 "Aren't their Heimwehr friends kinda violent? Someone else please."
 ost.6.b:0 "We reach an agreement!"
 ost.7.t:0 "The Old Coalition!"
 ost.7.d:0 "The old liberal parties seemed extra happy to be present at our organization's meeting for negotiations today. They, near universally, claim to be the only group able to keep our organization going. However, some conservatives and social democrats claim that Ostmarkers have been wishing for more, and the same-old-same-old will start to look undemocratic if we keep doing the same thing each election."
 ost.7.a:0 "Yeah, maybe it's time for change."
 ost.7.b:0 "We reach an agreement!"
 ost.10.t:0 "KPO Clashes With The Heimwehr!"
 ost.10.d:0 "Strung throughout the newspapers this morning were many clear pictures of KPO members violently engaging with Heimwehr members on the streets of Vienna - and descriptions of street brawls in just about any city with both parties present. This cannot bode well for the future of our coalition..."
 ost.10.a:0 "Let's hope it pulls through."
 ost.11.t:0 "The Heimwehr Blocks Poll Stations"
 ost.11.d:0 "When Ostmarkers went out to vote last night, there was nowhere for them to go. Local Heimwehr members across the nation held up polling booths all night, frequently with full support of local police forces. Voter turnout is estimated to have been in the single digits, with the Heimatblock winning a majority in the coalition. No other party is expected to have received any votes, except the DL-OFP ticket with an approximate 1000; not enough for a seat in any jurisdiction."
 ost.11.a:0 "Well..."
 ost.12.t:0 "Heimatblock Wins A Landslide Victory!"
 ost.12.d:0 "In a surprise to no one who knew what happened on election night, the Heimatblock has won over 90% of the national vote. Thus, the party has secured an absolute majority in the parliament. A centralized, but otherwise completely baseless group of nationalists, many are unsure if a multi-national federation can even exist under such a bizarre group of politicians."
 ost.12.a:0 "Let's see what a group of nationalists can do with a multi-national state."
 ost.14.t:0 "The Grand Coalition Wins A Close Majority!"
 ost.14.d:0 "Ostmark breathed a collective sigh of relief this morning, when the papers showed that Grand Coalition will continue governing with electoral support of the people. Hopefully, no maps will have to be thrown away any time soon."
 ost.14.a:0 "Let's fix Ostmark - again."
 ost.15.t:0 "The Grand Coalition Crumbles!"
 ost.15.d:0 "Fear. Fear is the word a former Grand Coalition member would use to describe the way it felt to hear that, without another party to invite, the Coalition could not expect to gain a majority in the next election. Already, the DL-OFP has begun increasing vastly in public support for its positivist pan-Ostmarker rhetoric in this incredibly turbulent time."
 ost.15.a:0 "We really should've known this would happen."
 ost.16.t:0 "DL-OFP Surpasses KPO And The Heimatblock"
 ost.16.d:0 "In a poll two weeks before the election, DL-OFP was shown polling higher than both KPO and the Heimatblock - combined. With a completely broken Grand Coalition, this makes them the largest single party in Ostmark by far."
 ost.16.a:0 "Great."
 ost.17.t:0 "DL-OFP Wins A Majority!"
 ost.17.d:0 "Any Ostmarker who's voted before would tell you that the polls were a lot emptier tonight than usual. Though there were some reported incidents of paramilitant groups clashing, most Ostmarkers who voted, voted cheerfully. It was no surprise when the results that DL-OFP had won a clear majority in parliament came in. The surprise would come later."
 ost.17.a:0 "A Witch, our leader! How exciting."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ostmark.10.t:0 "The Collapse Of The Federation"
 ostmark.10.d:0 "All at once, nations declared their independance from the Ostmarker Federation. The Heimatblock and military forces in the northwest gripped Bohemia; a pagan paramilitant group in the northeast; members of the KPO, SPO, and others in Pannonia; and national-liberals in the south erected states in what seemed like seconds. Ostmark was left with nothing but its core territory, the smallest it had been on the world map since a time many centuries ago."
 ostmark.10.a:0 "Perhaps the dream was a false one after all."
 ostmark.11.t:0 "The New Nations"
 ostmark.11.d:0 "We now have the option of playing another nation. This is not a fourth wall break, we're shipping you to another location."
 ostmark.11.a:0 "Bohemia!"
 ostmark.11.b:0 "The Rodish State!"
 ostmark.11.c:0 "Pannonia!"
 ostmark.11.e:0 "Next -->"
 ostmark.12.a:0 "Moesia (blue)!"
 ostmark.12.b:0 "National Ostmark!"
 ostmark.12.c:0 "<-- Back"
 ostmark.12.e:0 "[Filler, Don't Double Click]"
 
 ostmark.200.t:0 "Regaining our Support"
 ostmark.200.d:0 "The Ostmarker empire has been thrown into disarray. The many territories that our monarchs have ruled over for centuries have risen in revolt and, in the complete incompetence of our military, successfully established their own nations. All we have left are the territories with a Karlslander majority, who themselves lack the national identity to revolt against us. The stability once afforded to them is now gone - what do we do to regain their trust?"
 ostmark.200.a:0 "Ensure them that we will lead the nation in a direction beneficial to our people."
 ostmark.200.b:0 "Crush the disenters, so that we can ensure our rule over our Karlslander people will continue."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ost.300.t:0 "[OST.GetNameDef]'s Ultimatum" 
 ost.300.d:0 "[OST.GetNameDef] has sent us an extremely short ultimatum. It says, what amounts to, "join or die.""
 ost.300.a:0 "Their name on the map is pretty big..."
 ost.300.b:0 " 
 
 ost.1000.t:0 "Ostmark's Engelbert Dollfuss Goes Missing!"
 ost.1000.d:0 "In a shocking report given to the Ostmarker parliament, the executive guard has been unable to locate Engelbert Dollfuss, the conservative leader of the Grand Coalition. His charismatic figure being vacant from the building has made the announcement all the more gloomy, as politicans await for news on his finding.\nThe multi-national government has been governed by a large coalition of democratic parties since two election cycles ago, which has been criticized as resting on the stability given through the charisma of party leaders."
 ost.1000.a:0 "What does this mean for the future of the federation?"
