 NRO_1936_BOOKMARK:0 "Humanity has been aware of the Neuroi for a long time. Although under many names, many peoples shared in the experience of the destruction and violence they brought. However, it was not until twenty-two years ago that they would pose a genuine threat to strong civilizations. The [Great] Neuroi War saw a war more devastating than had ever been seen before.\nNineteen years later, the great remnants of humanity remain clueless. They squabble amongst each other as they had for millennia beforehand. As the Neuroi lay outside of humanity’s sights, the ancient beasts may find it is prime time to stand back up again."
 Decentralized_Consciousness_desc:0 "The Neuroi have no leader. They are believed to act almost entirely decentrally, destroying whatever is in its path without any single nucleus. Obvious cooperation is apparent on the tactical level, but any attempt to point to a single source of action is left fruitless.\n\nSince the Neuroi are not natural beings, they find very little use in Earth's resources or man's creations. Thus, their conquests are definitively total, and they leave behind only wasteland."
 NRO_no_profit_from_war_tooltip:0 "§RVictory in Neuroi wars result in the destruction of the enemy. Human capital and resources can't be used by Neuroi, so a victory results in a useless wasteland.§!"

 neuroi_body_0:0 "1916 Standard Body"
 neuroi_body_0_desc:0 "The backbone of the Neuroi 'army' are their basic armored bodies. Somewhere between a tank and a mechanical infantry, it would be feasible to achieve victory with these alone - if only the fleshthings didn't rush towards innovation at every turn."
 neuroi_body_1:0 "1936 Standard Body"
 neuroi_body_1_desc:0 "More competent designs can be incorporated, with better and thicker metallic shells and greater agility. We'll also be able to hit harder, though this will all come at the price of them taking longer to produce."
 neuroi_body_2:0 "1938 Standard Body"
 neuroi_body_2_desc:0 "We can continue to improve the armor and attack capabilities of our basic bodies to improve the backbone of our conquest."
 neuroi_body_3:0 "1940 Standard Body"
 neuroi_body_3_desc:0 "As our struggle against the empires of flesh continue, we will need to adapt to their new shell-piercing weaponry and advanced equipment. More improvements are necessary."
 neuroi_body_4:0 "1944 Standard Body"
 neuroi_body_4_desc:0 "No matter our situation, improvements to our standard shells will be a necessity if we are to achieve final victory. Improving our resiliance to the fleshthings' armour piercing shells, and improving our general attack capabilities will both be necessary."
 
 neuroi_airplane_0:0 "1916 Air Body"
 neuroi_airplane_0_desc:0 "Our forces in the air will no longer fight nearly unchallenged next time we attack, so we must be ready. Again, the driving innovation of the fleshthings' race deprive us from the conquest to which we are entitled, so we ourselves must evolve."
 neuroi_fighter_1:0 "1936 Air Body"
 neuroi_fighter_1_desc:0 "Though we can continue improving our airborne bodies further, it may be worth looking into specialization. It will require us to coordinate more than we have before, and to divide our resources, but it's undoubtful that the fleshthings' airforces will be a match for us in no time at all."
 neuroi_fighter_2:0 "1940 Air Body"
 neuroi_fighter_2_desc:0 "We continue to vastly outpace the fleshthings' fighters, but their 'witches' can still outpace our agility, and when they do, corner us into defeat."
 neuroi_fighter_3:0 "1944 Air Body"
 neuroi_fighter_3_desc:0 "Our air forces may be more diverse than ever now, but we cannot ignore what makes up the backbone of our air superiority efforts. We must take what we have learned and improve them in every aspect!"

 ### Focus Tree
 NRO_collecting_ourselves:0 "Collecting Ourselves"
 NRO_collecting_ourselves_desc:0 "We must finally recollect ourselves after our defeat by the machined apes. Our defeat is but a temporary setback to our total conquest, our complete annihilation of those fleshy animals and our ascent to dominance."
 NRO_gone_without_a_trace:0 "Gone Without a Trace"
 NRO_gone_without_a_trace_desc:0 "Like an 'alien from mars', we shall disguise and hide ourselves from the peering eyes of mankind. As we recoup ourselves, we cannot let them become aware of our developments and our movements lest they try to sneakily and frustratingly interrupt them."
 NRO_another_scout_mission:0 "Another Quiet Scout Mission"
 NRO_another_scout_mission_desc:0 "Men and their societies change so quickly. One day the brutish apes from Central Europe may be the strongest, the next the beast riding fleshthings from Asia, and the next time from Europe again. Preperation and knowledge of the world will bring us success, if only we make sure we stay up to date."
 NRO_restart_production:0 "Restart Production...\n...Again"
 NRO_restart_production_desc:0 "With the destruction of many of our members, we have largely stopped production of new beings... we must recover eventually, and no time is better than now; yes?"
 NRO_technology_progresses:0 "Technology Progresses"
 NRO_technology_progresses_desc:0 "As the fleshthings' technology progresses, we must keep up. If they can pump out 400 wheeled machines, we must pump out 800.\n\nRight now, we're not pumping out any. When we do, we must pump out more than any other."
 NRO_industrial_phen:0 "The 'Industrial' Phenomenon"
 NRO_industrial_phen_desc:0 "We were wrong to ignore the potential strength the buildings of metal and flame would give mankind. If we're going to keep up with their new productive capacity, we must start producing stuff yesterday."
 NRO_and_so_do_we:0 "...And So Do We"
 NRO_and_so_do_we_desc:0 "As the fleshthings progress, so shall we. While they can fly in planes at less than 'one-hundred miles per hour', our bodies will take us twice as fast. In the face of incomporable technology, mankind will be no contest."
 NRO_more_bodies:0 "More Bodies"
 NRO_more_bodies_desc:0 "We need more members. There is no other way to explain it - if we cannot fill their fields and mountains, then we have no war to wage. Every body must be assigned a core, and we must make sure our cores have bodies to match."
 NRO_newer_maps:0 "Drawing Newer Maps"
 NRO_newer_maps_desc:0 "We will reengage ourselves with the political and militant reality of the fleshthings' world, so that we can know which places are the most vulnerable and the most lucrative. Our scout mission may have shown Europe's continued dominance, but we're not so ignorant to think this is true for all of them."
 NRO_steps_to_seaworthiness:0 "Our Steps to Seaworthiness"
 NRO_steps_to_seaworthiness_desc:0 "The water still eludes us, as we fear its corrosive power of oxygen. Still, defeat in the ocean has ruined many of our conquests; if we could just become properly seaworthy, the fleshthings would stand no chance."
 NRO_Hispanian_campaign:0 "A Foothold in Europe"
 NRO_Hispanian_campaign_desc:0 "Our maps and scout mission show Hispania to be ripe for invasion. Much of Europe is lax, so invading far from it would only give them time to prepare; and would be ignoring the obvious advantages of a lazy and ignorant Europe. Hispania specifically sits backwards and weak, uncaring of the conflict which neared its borders only decades ago."
 NRO_forges_of_basalt:0 "Forges of Basalt"
 NRO_forges_of_basalt_desc:0 "Our 'forges' are from those of igneous rock and iron: black and hard from the substance of rock melted from the flames of Earth itself. Our bodies are an extension of the great metallic Earth and its power, and to conquer the fleshthings we must embrace the hardness and power it can grant us."
 NRO_from_matter_to_machine:0 "From Matter to Machine"
 NRO_from_matter_to_machine_desc:0 "Unlike the schemes of mankind, our bodies are ourselves - we need no blueprints or technology. We improve solely through a recognition of our flaws and finding a solution of those, not the brains of single individuals. If we must, we can focus on the advancement of ourselves without requiring luck or ingenuity."
 NRO_above_the_cities_of_man:0 "Above the Cities of Man"
 NRO_above_the_cities_of_man_desc:0 "Maybe our success lays in the sky.\n\nWe attempted such last time, but our dedication to the concept was underwhelming at best. Mankind is still wholely unequipped to deal with attacks from the air if not performed like traditional machines - and the retirement of all their veterans will certainly not help."
 NRO_crystals_and_lasers:0 "Crystals and Lasers"
 NRO_crystals_and_lasers_desc:0 "Our souls are made of crystal, and thus our weapons are that of lasers. Mankind still has no defence against these but the shields of the gifted and metal thick enough to repel it temporarily. Still, a stronger attack is a greater hit to stamina and a more easily destroyed machine; both of which are benefits worth pursuing."
 NRO_wombs_of_modernity:0 "Cores for Modernity"
 NRO_wombs_of_modernity_desc:0 "Our core production must meet the needs of modern warfare. To wage war against the fleshworld is to wage war against all its inhabitants, and we need to be producing many more members if we are to ever reach our vision." 
 NRO_directing_production:0 "Directing Production"
 NRO_directing_production_desc:0 "We must streamline the production of our bodies. Rock and iron does not forge itself, and if we can control it, we must do it faster."
 NRO_preperation_for_total_conquest:0 "Preperation For Total Conquest"
 NRO_preperation_for_total_conquest_desc:0 "Our consciousness must be prepared for another assault on the fleshworld. It must be working at optimum potential, and must be totally willing to sacrifice its members for its own glory. If it is not, then we cannot expect to stand above the nations of men that can."
 NRO_hive_hierarchy:0 "Hive Hierarchy"
 NRO_hive_hierarchy_desc:0 "All hives will be organized into a new 'hierarchy' to ensure that cooperation between members is as efficient as possible. Our largest hives should not be focused on keeping men out of our areas of conquest, but on the production of our greatest works."
 NRO_born_in_rage:0 "Born in Rage"
 NRO_born_in_rage_desc:0 "For millennia we have tried to seize the lands of the Earth from the fleshthings that conquered it. Yet every attempt we fail, only finally making success in Asia a decade ago - from which we have lost complete contact. Next time, we will not leave their buildings standing or their farms fertile.\nThe fleshthings shall know what we have felt."
 NRO_the_failures_of_ancients:0 "The Failures of Ancients"
 NRO_the_failures_of_ancients_desc:0 "The ancients have failed in their ignorance of the rate at which mankind can improve its technology. We must finally overcome this issue and outpace mankind totally and completely, as we know we can."
 NRO_the_successes_of_men:0 "The Successes of Men"
 NRO_the_successes_of_men_desc:0 "Mankind succeeds in their own wars through collective unity and strategy. We must make sure our consciousness is at peak performance, not subject to any delays or setbacks."
 NRO_the_superhive:0 "The Superhive"
 NRO_the_superhive_desc:0 "A giant hive will bring us the capacity we need during war. Occupying a more machined world means being aware of the difficulties that will entail, and only giant hubs of member and body production will allow us to do this."
 NRO_fuso_is_vulnerable:0 "Fuso Is Vulnerable"
 NRO_fuso_is_vulnerable_desc:0 "The 'mighty nation' of Fuso sits decadentally unaware and uncaring of our activity in Hispania. Their strength is unparalled in Asia, and ridding of them will be necessary.\nWith our attack on Fuso, our great reclamation of the Earth inhabitated by machined manthings will begin.\nLet their cities burn, their crops perish, and their militaries crumble."

 NRO_the_striker_problem:0 "The Striker Problem"
 NRO_the_striker_problem_desc:0 "The cursed fleshthings have found a way to counter our agility in the air. By placing... young females in machines which wrap around their lower limbs, they can act as infantry in the sky against our own sky infantry. We can no longer rely solely on our vastly superior air agility, and we must prepare for this."
 NRO_over_seas:0 "Over Seas"
 NRO_over_seas_desc:0 "We may not be able to swim, but we can definitely fly. Our superiority in the domain of the air will bring our conquest to victory, and we should invest in that the most."
 NRO_a_warning_of_our_might:0 "A Warning of Our Might"
 NRO_a_warning_of_our_might_desc:0 "The Fusoans have no idea what they could be up against. We should show them - even the most basic of us can blast every one of their flying machines out of the sky with ease. And though our knowledge advances alongside their own, we can let our strength in the air drive us to even greater advancements."
 NRO_land_supremacy:0 "Land Supremacy"
 NRO_land_supremacy_desc:0 "The battle for this planet will ultimately occur on the ground which the fleshthings tread on. The air may bring us victory in battle, but if we cannot maintain what we have conquered, then a purposeful conquest it is not."
 NRO_teasing_the_fusoans:0 "Teasing the Fusoans"
 NRO_teasing_the_fusoans_desc:0 "We can slowly rub against the Fusoan military as long as we want, but if the fleshthings are not terrified of us, then we are not at our full potential."
 NRO_overwhelming_force:0 "Overwhelming Force"
 NRO_overwhelming_force_desc:0 "We shall be an overwhelming force in number and in strength, able to overcome the fleshthings' militaries as a flood of metal and rock. No human nation shall stop us in our conquest for this planet, no matter their industrial capacity or the strength of their 'wills'."
 NRO_strategic_advancement:0 "Strategic Advancement"
 NRO_strategic_advancement_desc:0 "War changes as the fleshthings change, and thus we must adapt as well. We must make sure we always know how to counter what humanity throws at us, so we can throw it twice as hard back."
 NRO_anticipating_the_ground_war:0 "Anticipating the Ground War"
 NRO_anticipating_the_ground_war_desc:0 "The ground war in Fuso will be inevitable. We must anticipate this, and make sure our land forces are up to snuff for the oncoming conquest."
 NRO_from_the_skies:0 "From the Skies"
 NRO_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Remember, we attack from the skies. We must be able to secure the land which we want to conquer, even if it lays over seas, and for this we must be able to defeat whatever forces already exist in the land which we find ourselves on - without exception."
 NRO_suffer_no_coastline:0 "Suffer No Coastline"
 NRO_suffer_no_coastline_desc:0 "We shall suffer no coastlines in our conquest. We may still not be seaworthy, but we will eventually, and until that point we must be positive our alternatives are just as viable for attacking fleshy island nations."
 NRO_magic_again:0 "Magic, Again"
 NRO_magic_again_desc:0 "We thought we were done with these endowed fleshthings, but here they are again, blocking our attacks and destroying us in the air. Our conquest will not fail because of children in stilts, and we will show the fleshthings that we are worse than any conquest they have waged against eachother."
 NRO_the_struggle_continues:0 "The Struggle Continues"
 NRO_the_struggle_continues_desc:0 "As the struggle continues, we must be sure we can flood the skies to the absolute despair of the Fusoan air force. It is a necessity towards our strategy, and will deliver us glorious retribution against the flying adolescents each time we blast one into the ocean below."
 NRO_final_offensive:0 "Final Offensive"
 NRO_final_offensive_desc:0 "It's becoming clear that our efforts in Fuso cannot be our only angle of attack against humanity. Our consciousness shall direct us into the most enthused struggle against the Fusoans we have yet gone through, but if it fails, we will have to look elsewhere before wiping them off the map."
 NRO_letting_fuso_brew:0 "Letting Fuso Brew"
 NRO_letting_fuso_brew_desc:0 "It's clear Fuso is a lost cause on its own. We must look elsewhere - our old brothers in Zhonggou will surely let us back when it comes time to return again."
 NRO_letting_fuso_brew_tooltip:0 "If we take this focus, we will §Rforfeit our territories in Zhongguo§! to focus our attacks on §YEurope§! in §C60 days§!!"
 NRO_conquest_industry:0 "Conquest Industry"
 NRO_conquest_industry_desc:0 "Our 'industry' is built for conquest and conquest alone. The earth is ours, every other goal or ideal cannot even be visualized. When the ash settles, the earth shall lay in the hands of our metal, our rock, and our might - not the fleshy hands of humankind."
 NRO_pull_cores_from_zhonggou:0 "Pull Cores From Zhonggou!"
 NRO_pull_cores_from_zhonggou_desc:0 "What are they even doing in Zhonggou?! They should be helping us! That nation is long dead, and they clearly have no intention to expand - they must give some of their occupational cores to us, to aid in conquest which will actually elevate us to dominance."
 NRO_metallic_overdrive:0 "Metallic Overdrive"
 NRO_metallic_overdrive_desc:0 "We don't have to stop there, we can push the production of our bodies even further. With this effort, we will begin to reach heights of efficiency and mass production never seen before; from the ancients to our late friends."
 NRO_flood_the_skies:0 "Flood the Skies"
 NRO_flood_the_skies_desc:0 "Let the sky turn black in a flood of metal and stone, to literally block out the light of the sun and the blue of the sky during our conquest struggles against the fleshthings. We require a greater pool of cores, and expanding that is the greatest necessity."
 NRO_strike_dacia:0 "§RStrike Dacia§!"
 NRO_strike_dacia_desc:0 "Humanity will definitely come to Dacia's aid, but our conquest was always meant to be a struggle against them all, was it not?\nHowever, we should know that, soon, the strongest empires the fleshthings rule will be against us.\n\nWe will show them that the future belongs to us, and us alone."

 NRO_and_so_do_we_tooltip:0 "Will begin to give you §YNeuroi Armor§! in proportion to your §Yweekly manpower gain§!."

 NRO_gone_without_a_trace_idea:0 "Invisible Entity"
 NRO_gone_without_a_trace_idea_desc:0 "The Neuroi have no notable presence on Earth at the moment, and since it's impossible for any human nation to gather intel on something that may as well not exist, it is impossible to gather intel on the Neuroi."


 ### Events
 neuroi.1.t:0 "1936 Scout Mission"
 neuroi.1.d:0 "Through only a couple more decades, we've become aware of how much the world continues to change. Fuso exerts itself in the East, as monarchies die and the other human nations return to normalcy. As the engine, both magical and purely mechanical, is used more and more, we feel only stronger and stronger.\n\nOur scouts have been reporting for years that a development seen at the end of our great campaign a couple decades ago has been put to widespread use: manmade armor. This is no worry for us, it simply means we will take another great step forward before our next great campaign. Humanity will come to fear us again, as the rightful inheritors of this giant rock."
 neuroi.2.t:0 "Newer Maps"
 neuroi.2.d:0 "Though we have no need for maps in the 'traditional' sense, our knowledge of the political sphere can't be derived from detached observation. Through the combined experiences of our scouts, we note that Fuso still controls a vast amount of territory. Hispania continues to face economic decline, and may be a good feeling ground for our return.\n\nIn less pressing relevancy, Karlsland and Gallia both face radical political divisions. The nations around the Black Sea continue to lag behind their neighbors to the west, but Liberion's strength has grown exponentially. All of this will be considered when we begin our campaign."
