#### Belgica
 BLG_noblemans_country:0 "Nobleman's Country"
 BLG_noblemans_country_desc:0 "Belgica is a nobleman's country. Great, old noble families prosper here, even as they were overtaken by the burghers in the Netherlands and by modern capitalists in many of our neighbors. In Belgica, tradition prospers - even when our labour force wished they did instead."
 BLG_strengthen_PvBS:0 "Strengthen PvBS"
 BLG_strengthen_PvBS_desc:0 "The 'Politie van de Belgican Staat', our state's police force, was instrumental in putting down the 1935 strikes. If we want to overcome potential future issues, we should reward them with funding to help secure our positions."
 BLG_whip_petty_nobles:0 "Whip Petty Nobles"
 BLG_whip_petty_nobles_desc:0 "A lot of petty nobles don't like some of the institutions that are intended to benefit them. Some, especially those with especially gifted children, would prefer they could take their own path or secure their lineage. We need to show them that the Belgican state, more than any other, has their best interests in mind."
 BLG_lessons_from_nats:0 "Lessons from the Nationalists"
 BLG_lessons_from_nats_desc:0 "The Nationalists in other nations have been able to weild impressive control over the populace, outside of just the political realm. We should take inspiration from them, and aim to weild our influence in the arts and education to convince our subjects to love the Belgican state as much as we do."
 BLG_revoke_working_hour_laws:0 "Revoke Working Hour Laws"
 BLG_revoke_working_hour_laws_desc:0 "Labour legislation which restricts the amount of time a worker is allowed to work is ridiculous. If we're going to become a more powerful country, we will need all the dedicated and loyal workers we can get. Many nobles have been calling for us to revert these outdated laws, so let's do so."
 BLG_using_our_coffers:0 "Using Our Coffers"
 BLG_using_our_coffers_desc:0 "Our coffers are famously deep. Some people would argue they're infamously deep, but luckily, they don't reside here to fill our ears with such garbage. Regardless, we should probably be using some of our wealth to help arm and protect ourselves too."
 BLG_the_flame_of_revolution:0 "The Flame of Revolution"
 BLG_the_flame_of_revolution_desc:0 "The Ancien Régime falls! The ancient, decrepit, reactionary Belgican state is on its absolute final legs as the industrial workers grow closer together! No longer will we have to listen to blabbering inbreds, but instead to the thoughtful insights of our comrades."
 BLG_nobles_no_more:0 "Nobles No More"
 BLG_nobles_no_more_desc:0 "The nobility have not earned our sympathy - in fact, they have earned quite the opposite. Perhaps the revolution could have been achieved without violence if it wasn't for them. Regardless, the nobles must have their property seized and must be removed as a distinct class as quickly as possible."
 BLG_establish_the_councils:0 "Establishing the Councils"
 BLG_establish_the_councils_desc:0 "Workers Councils are the most effective way to achieve communism in Belgica. The notions of a "vanguard" and of unorganized communes are equally dangerous, as both can collapse into old authoritarianism or complete chaos. Workers Councils will also be able to replace the decrepit organizational structures we got rid of."
 BLG_disint_of_libs:0 "Disintegration of the Liberals"
 BLG_disint_of_libs_desc:0 "Although populist liberals were already quite rare in Belgica, due to the fear that liberalism would not sufficiently guard against the abuses of the nobility, our revolution has been able to successfully disuade even the most staunch liberals in Belgica. It seems the entire country is on our side!"
 BLG_com_in_unlikely_places:0 "Communism in the Most Unlikely of Places"
 BLG_com_in_unlikely_places_desc:0 "If you asked someone what Western European country was the furthest from an equal society one decade ago, they almost certainly would have said Belica. But look at where we are now! No other country is as close to achieving communism as us, all while overthrowing one of the worst institutions in recent European history."
 BLG_another_hole:0 "Another Hole in the Workforce"
 BLG_another_hole_desc:0 "Seriously, another strike? This is starting to get ridiculous. How are we supposed to maintain an economy when our labour force keeps throwing themselves against us? No worries, we can still solve this just like we have before."
 BLG_some_reform:0 "Maybe Some Reforms"
 BLG_some_reform_desc:0 "The best way we can prvent this is to reform or labor laws just a little. This way, we can show the most opportunistic of them that we do have them in mind, and hopefully the most ideological will back down as their movement shrinks."
 BLG_snip_off_the_head:0 "Snipping off the Head"
 BLG_snip_off_the_head_desc:0 "Or even better, we can just 'snip off the head' of some of these movements. Without the proper leadership, many of these organizations would be unable to coordinate strikes, and our position can be further secured."
 BLG_beef_up_intel_serv:0 "Beefing up our Intelligence Services"
 BLG_beef_up_intel_serv_desc:0 "We probably haven't been using our intelligence services enough either. Although the secret police is nice, it'd also be nice to get some proper insight on the inner workings of these movements if we want to crush them. Additionally, this will come in handy when dealing with aggressive foreign powers or foreign agitation."
 BLG_close_the_borders:0 "Closing the Borders"
 BLG_close_the_borders_desc:0 "Ultimately, this 'communism' is a foreign ideal, invented by a Karlslander. Foreign influences have been tearing apart our country for too long. As other nations are beginning to out-perform us economically again, it might be time for us to finally shut down our borders again and focus on ourselves."

 belgica.1.t:0 "Massive Strike!"
 belgica.1.d:0 "On [GetDate], a massive organized strike broke out in Brussels. Not a single worker could be seen in some factories, including floor managers and high skill workers. The strikers could be heard shouting everything from communist and republican slogans to simple demands for any labor legislation at all. Within even that day, the crowds became so large that it was impossible for PvBS to break up the strikes. The strikes were maintained for days, as strikers brought food and supplies to allow the demonstrations to be kept up for days. The factories, all noble owned, are already reaching a position where they have no backstock to ship to fill demand; so strikes are beginning to take a serious toll. It may take weeks for the strikes to die down enough to deal with."

 ORU_our_vast_expanse_desc:0 "We must not pursue industrialization too quickly. Although we still lag behind much of Europe in strength, we have been able to catch up technologically. We should instead focus on preventing famine, as to avoid instability and tragedy."
 ORU_catching_up:0 "Catching Up"
 ORU_catching_up_desc:0 "Orussia is only a few steps away from being on-par with the rest of Europe! We should focus our efforts on expanding our industrial base, so that we can compete on the same economic playing field as our European bretheren, and avoid another embarassment from Fuso."
 ORU_promote_mech:0 "Promoting Farm Mechanization"
 ORU_promote_mech_desc:0 "We should be promoting the mechanization of Orussian farms. Although some have opted to purchase the equipment themselves, the economic pressure to do so has not been nearly enough. We should be subsidizing their implementation."
 ORU_promote_mech_idea:0 "Promote Mechanization"
 ORU_memories_of_the_war:0 "Moving on from \nThe Neuroi War"
 ORU_memories_of_the_war_desc:0 "The Neuroi War still lays heavy in the minds of many. Already facing extreme political instability, it was a miracle that the Empire was able to survive. Now that it's been a few decades, and new generations are taking over the old, it's time for the Orussian military to step into the future."
 ORU_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidize Industry"
 ORU_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "We should grant subsidies to those wishing to establish industrial centers. Although this will require us to turn our attention away from other industries, it should be a net positive for our aims."
 ORU_subsidize_industry_idea:0 "Subsidized Industrial Construction"
 ORU_extend_regional_autonomy:0 "Extend Regional Autonomy"
 ORU_extend_regional_autonomy_desc:0 "Orussia is a diverse empire. Many minority groups, especially in the west, desire more representation of their needs and cultures. We should grant them more political autonomy, which will reduce our political strength; but will help ensure the Orussian Empire lasts."

 ORU_modernize_local_political_structures_desc:0 "Many regional governments use archaic forms of 'democracy', or are still entirely monarchic in nature.

 ORU_invest_over_urals:0 "Invest Over the Urals"
 ORU_invest_over_urals_desc:0 "We should try to build up our industry over the urals too. Many Orussians live there, who may feel ignored compared to those closer to Moscow. And, of course, a more prosperous society is a more stable one."
 ORU_sr_legislative_victory:0 "SR Legislative Victory"

 ORU_steps_to_repub_desc:0 "Forming an Orussian Republic will be no easy task. We'll need to convince millions that republicanism is the way forward, but with Orussia embracing democracy as a whole, it should be a possible task."

 ORU_back_on_track:0 "Back on Track"

 ORU_an_oru_miracle:0 "An Orussian Miracle"
 ORU_an_oru_miracle_desc:0 "The success of the Orussian Empire in recent years can only be described as a miracle! We have narrowly avoided chaos, and narrowly defeated destruction from an alien threat. It's time we step back and appreciate the country we worked so hard to protect."
