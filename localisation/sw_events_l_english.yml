However, his cabinet made it clear that we can refuse with no repercussions."

 ostmark.100.d:0 "The Kaiser of Karlsland has reached out to our royal family to reestablish our weathered ties. Since the last neuroi war, we've slipped from our monarchist roots to appeal to the many minority groups in our nation. Karlsland sees us as a strong ally still, however, and sees the House of Habsburg as their primary form of connection."
 ostmark.100.a:0 "We would love to reestablish relations!"

 ostmark.109.t:0 "Our Ultimatum to Ostmark"
 ostmark.109.d:0 "Ostmark, our historical ally, has not been holding itself up to any military standards since the Great Neuroi War. We're aware this is due to internal problems involving the nationalistic tendencies of internal groups, but it's much too dangerous of a geopolitical situation for our Empire.\n\nThus, we'll issue an ultimatum - increase your military capacity in the next year to our standards, or else be subjegated."
 ostmark.109.a:0 "Do it."
 ostmark.109.b:0 "Wait - we're all having problems right now. Let them cope."

 ostmark.111.t:0 "Subjegation of Ostmark"

 ostmark.111.a:0 "An event that will mark Central Europe forever."

 ostmark.114.t:0 "Ostmark Succumbs to the Ultimatum"
 ostmark.114.d:0 "We have succumbed to the ultimatum sent to us by Karlsland. Our subjegated status will certainly not bode well with our populace.\n\nFurthermore, the original Ostmarker lands will be annexed fully into the Karlsland Empire, removing the Ostmarker Emperor from his most important landed title and returning a culturally important area back to Karlsland."
 ostmark.114.a:0 "One of our darkest days."

 britannia.20.t:0 "The Karlslander Republic wishes to join the United Nations"
 britannia.20.d:0 "The newly established democratic government of Karlsland has been in search of an ally since their new inception, and has turned away from their former partner Ostmark in favor of our sphere. To say our two nations have not been friendly in the past would be an understatement, but Karlsland's new government will render this context useless. They would make an amazing addition to the Allies, but we always have the authority to deny them entry."
 britannia.20.a:0 "Of course!"
 britannia.20.b:0 "...We could never ally with the Karlslanders."
 
 britannia.21.t:0 "The Karlsland Empire's Anti-Neuroi Pact"
 britannia.21.d:0 "The Karlsland Empire has approached us with a new proposal - a pact against the Neuroi or any other aggressor. They aren't asking to join the United Nations, but for us and Gallia to gurantee that we'll support them in case of military conflict. They have also proposed, alongside the alliance, the potential for sharing specifically Strike Witches between nations in joint units; so that the inevitable event of another Neuroi attack can be mutually defended against for the benefit of all."
 britannia.21.a:0 "Of course!"
 britannia.21.b:0 "...We could never ally with the Karlslanders."

 politicalnews.100.d:0 "In an event shocking to all but Karlslanders themselves, the long monarchy of Karlsland has been ursurped by the nation's pagan-nationalist party. The new regime immedietely proclaimed ambition to not only spread their historic religious nationalism to the rest of Europe, but to maintain Karlsland's position as a military giant in defense against the ever persistent Neuroi. Hanna Rudel, spokesperson and face for the Heidnische Einheitsfront, has publically declared that the new regime will utilize the Karlsland witch population to a militant extent never seen before. Their neighbors, anticipating the rise of democracy in the large nation, are dissapointed."
