 kwitches.1.d:0 "Karlslander researches have been hard at work designing new tools to harness the possibilities of our witch population. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled and leg mounted designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. Many of our researches already see great promise in the leg mounted designs.\n\nDespite our great traditions, we have very little witches available to assign these units to. Perhaps expanding our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense, we have one of the largest populations in the world."

Seeing no other course of action, with his nation in full (maybe not voluntary) support of the party, the Kaiser's regent had no reasonable choice but to accept. The monarchy's abdication resulted in the immediete implementation of a supreme executive, to be elected only on death, and who would formally head the Norse religion. With power cemented, the first order of the excecutive leader, the brutal witch Hanna Rudel; was to switch the ban on Romagnan religion on its head. Europe trembles with this momentous shift, and what's to come can only be feared."
