 karlsland.552.t:0 "Picking a Shaman"
 karlsland.552.d:0 "Rudel sat at her desk, an unnatural position for her. She would have preferred to be flying, but her personal assistant had forced her - about as close as anyone could say they forced Rudel to do anything - to rest after breaking her right leg again. After thrusting herself to the top of the national council, and immediately disbanding it, Rudel had found normal governance quite boring. She found herself looking out the giant window opposite her desk, thinking that she would have much preferred to be bombing those mechanical aliens from the sky, and not directing funds to pay for the preservation of some grove on the other side of Karlsland.\n\nAnd suddenly, her eyes jumped down to the pen in her hand. She would hire someone to do that boring work for her! Writing plainly, she directed a letter to the entirety of the party staff, declaring her need for a “shaman” to help her on the more “daunting” tasks of connecting to the “spirits of her ancestors”.\n\nA week later, there were three candidates. The first was a relatively well educated man who wore a pair of glasses, which completed his notably academic appearance. His endorsers claim he has been fascinated with the old traditions of Karlsland since (probably) his formative years - and he is by far the most popular choice within the party. Additionally, it says that he would aid greatly in accelerating the national conversion process, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course.\n\nThe second is a renowned occultist who had recently emigrated from Ostmark. He is the most popular among the youth in our party for his eccentric and extensive belief in the power of ice. Though his appearance is not nearly as professional as the other man, his extraordinarily long beard and his obsession with robes makes him a perfect fit for the profession in the Karlslander’s eyes. He claims to have very little administrative experience at all, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course.\n\nThe last candidate is Rudel’s old war partner, Adelheid. Though suspected of going under the guise of “Comrade Leader” and attempting to start a workers uprising, Rudel is fully aware of the slanderous and false nature of this accusation. Though she is not particularly favoured by the party or the public, she undoubtedly complements Rudel well - and is the only one who could provide free milk. Additionally, she seems to have an uncanny knack for organizing groups of people, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course."

Those who called the traditional Karlslander ways heathenism and hateful. Even those who once sat on the council then claimed Rudel’s autocratic tendencies would lead only to human conflict. Who was allowing them to say these things? To espouse these lies? An inactive party. The party’s forces had to be sharpened up, Rudel decided. They had to hunt out traitors on the ground the same way she hunted alien demons from the sky.\n\nAnd if they wouldn’t start shaping up, then Rudel would have to start cleaning ranks herself."
 karlsland.553.a:0 "Good."
 karlsland.554.t:0 "The Runes Speak"
 karlsland.554.d:0 "After recovering from her broken leg, Rudel immediately began flying - again. Over forests and fields, she caught sight of brass music being played in a small village. She saw as a stubborn clergyman of the Romagnan Church was driven out of his home village and nearly shot in the back.\n\nRudel did occasionally listen to the spiritual drivel pour out from her shaman’s mouth, as they helped her get through the day or write another speech, but she never felt it in herself. The party was always just a way for Rudel to mold Karlsland in her image, without the annoyances of the Kaiser or competing military officials. She was attracted to the marches that inspired her to enlist as a young girl in the first place; the joyful enthusiasm for conflict that she had felt every day when she flew out, which she had thought no one shared. Maybe, she thought, she was a little attracted to the ancient myths of gifted female soldiers who, alone, could ascend to the afterlife alongside men. Or maybe it was just the propaganda.\n\nEither way, when one of those villagers missed the clergyman and hit Rudel’s striker (completely unaware it was her overhead, to be fair) and she landed in front of that stone, she had regretted not listening. The stone - it beckoned to her. It recited, in a language which sounded familiar but which was entirely unintelligible at the same time; poems. They had a pleasant, consistent scheme, which beckoned the leader even closer. Slowly reaching her arm out, crawling, walking across the forest floor; she touched the stone.\n\nAnd it was then that she understood. Understood why she led Karlsland now, why, out of so many other possibledirections, she was the one chosen to lead. It was not just to kill, not just to pursue that ecstasy she felt years ago. It was so much more. She had a duty to Karlslanders, throughout every dimension of time, to restore the greatness of their people and the knowledge that was lost.\n\nAfter dusting herself off, Rudel took a bit of the stone that had broken off for herself."

 karlsland.555.t:0 "Neuroi"
 karlsland.555.d:0 "Rudel was sitting on a chair, in a large, empty dining room. An empty plate sat in front of her, but she was staring at a burning fireplace. She didn’t take breaks often, and this one in particular was largely unintentional. She simply sat there, staring.\n\nNo one knew where they came from, but they’d always been there. Terrorising civilizations, evolving to just barely overcome the technological advances of humanity, slaughtering and burning without any purpose or direction at seemingly random intervals throughout history. The Rätsel were implicated in the oldest human myths as monsters and demons; as serpents that encircle the earth or lanky figures that could clear a human village in an hour. But there was never an explanation or a reason. The girl from Fuso learned nothing in making contact with them, negotiations had infamously failed from every attempt in early history to contemporary modernity.\n\nThis had not bothered Rudel. Rudel only cared about the thrill of the fight, of the joy which (literally) shocked her bones as she dove towards the bizarre machines and blew them to pieces. But the runes had a profound effect on her. Why were these unbiological, unearthly things so intent on conquering lands which held seemingly no use or purpose to them?\n\nUnfortunately, Rudel found no answers in herself. A disappointing conclusion indeed, but one which the ancestors appeared to have reached as well, as even her chunk of the runestone fell silent when she went to question it."

Seeing no other course of action, with his nation in full (maybe not voluntary) support of the party, the Kaiser's regent had no reasonable choice but to accept. The monarchy's abdication resulted in the immediete implementation of a supreme executive, to be elected only on death, and who would formally head the Norse religion. With power cemented, the first order of the excecutive leader, the brutal witch Hanna Rudel; was to switch the ban on Romagnan religion on its head. Europe trembles with this momentous shift, and what's to come can only be feared."

Even in service she struggled to cooperate with her comrades who came from free and personal farms, or a bourgeois private city life. There's nothing that would make her happier than seeing the masses, once serving under the traditional leadership of the nobility, turn away from liberalism and return to their estates. Even if that requires force - a lot of it."
 noble.1.a:0 "Sounds rather depressing..."
 noble.2.t:0 "Council of Nobles"
 noble.2.d:0 "A large group of well dressed Karlslanders were gathered in the Reichstag. It was a largely unorganized gathering, started by Heinrike in order to decide what the goals of the new state would be. The unorganized nature of the meeting, not helped by the youthfulness of many of the nobles, gave rise to more radical discussion. In the end, the group of young nobles had decided that the old Karlslander system was not enough - they wanted to truly assert themselves as the rulers of a new Karlsland, free from any interference to their power above or below:\n\nFears of everything from liberalism, revolution, and fervent religious nationalism were spread throughout the meeting; and the new government was to inherently prevent these strains of thought from ever finding themselves in the minds of the citizenry. The nobility, and the nobility alone, were to decide the fate of their subject estates. The Princess, adressing the group with a smile, said, 'Soon, we will never again have to subjegate our own successes to those unnatural triumphs of the commoner.'"
 noble.2.a:0 "What about the Kaiser?"
 noble.3.t:0 "Extraditing the Kaiser"
 noble.3.d:0 "Kaiser Frederick IV, though still a popular figure to much of the public, was apprehended by supporters of the Noble Council yesterday. Without much hesitation, Heinrike had her former leader sent on a passanger train straight to the Low Countries, where he would be held by Gallian loyalists to prevent any attempts at reasserting his throne. Of course, some Karlslanders weren't pleased with a removal of Frederick IV. Without proper leadership in east Karlsland, however, they're unlikely to pose a well organized threat."
 noble.3.a:0 "Good."
 
 
 noble.50.t:0 "A Deal With the Magocracy"
 noble.50.d:0 "The Magocracy in Saxony, lead by a rapidly assembled council of witches, has not had the time to develop its own sense of patriotic purpose. Many of the more conservative witches see promise in our state, but wish to be more than what they were before the collapse gave them the opportunity. Thus, the idea that we could allow these witches to continue their project in Saxony alone, under our guidance, has become fairly popular within their regime. Though fully integrating Saxony would clearly allow us to truly unify Karlsland again, [Root.GetLeader] finds themselves asking if true unification is actually a goal, or just a means to an end..."
 noble.50.a:0 "...No, this isn't what I had in mind."
 noble.50.b:0 "An interesting project indeed."
