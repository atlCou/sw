 KAR_rudel_alone_desc:0 "Sitting on the ruins of the Kaiser's throne, Rudel has finally taken the nation through the force of her will. Like the military see served so strongly under, she makes a pledge to lead Karlsland like an army marching head-on into its future..."
 KAR_clean_ranks:0 "Clean The Ranks"
 KAR_clean_ranks_desc:0 "There are still some who won’t follow Rudel. Those who saw the way she fought against the Neuroi years ago and now refuse to put on their boots and march behind the witch that saved Karlsland. Those who call the traditional Karlslander ways “heathenism”. Even those who once sat on the council now claim Rudel’s autocratic tendencies will lead only to human conflict."
 KAR_hire_a_mystic:0 "Hire a Mystic"
 KAR_hire_a_mystic_desc:0 "Parts of the MSKP government have strongly suggested to Rudel that she hire a personal "mystic", in order to help her run parts of the government she doesn't particularly care about doing but that cannot be delegated to any specific office."
 KAR_the_runes_talk:0 "The Runes Speak"
 KAR_the_runes_talk_desc:0 "It was then that she understood. Understood why she led Karlsland now, why, out of so many other possible directions and candidates and opportunities, she was the one chosen to lead. She had a duty to Karlslanders, throughout every dimension of time, to restore the greatness of their people and the knowledge that was lost."
 KAR_unearthly_neuroi:0 "Unearthly Neuroi"
 KAR_unearthly_neuroi_desc:0 "What are the Neuroi? Or, who are the Neuroi? Where are they from? Why are they here? All questions which have interested Karlslanders since they first carved their alphabet into rocks; and which Rudel may finally have the resources to answer..."
 KAR_friends_in_baltland:0 "Friends in Baltland"
 KAR_friends_in_baltland_desc:0 "Is a Baltlander and a Karlslander much different? Many would say they're very similar. Maybe too similar. As old texts and her mystic speak of a superhuman land in the far north, Rudel believes Baltland may hold passage to that mysterious island."
 KAR_transcendental_academia:0 "Transcendental Academia"
 KAR_transcendental_academia_desc:0 "Before the MSKP seized the reins of power, academia was plagued by materialistic and degenerate research. But now that Karlsland is in proper hands, we can start to reform academia so it serves the Karlslander people - not the other way around!" 
 KAR_they_still_practice:0 "They Still Practice"
 KAR_they_still_practice_desc:0 "Even though we've burnt down their churches, pushed them out of their towns, strongarmed their local governments and locked up the most pious; the damn Romagnanists are still practicing!"
 KAR_the_island_in_the_north:0 "The Island in the North"
 KAR_the_island_in_the_north_desc:0 "A great island lays in the north, yet unexplored. As our history says, the greatest races in the world descended outwards from a great, northern place which held unequivocal knowledge. To make a nation of overmen, Rudel must find this place. She must return to our homeland of tradition, and bring us out of a millennia of darkness and lost knowledge. We're hoping Svalbard holds the answers..."
 KAR_alternative_cosmology:0 "Alternative Cosmology"
 KAR_alternative_cosmology_desc:0 "This notion of an expanding universe, of atheistic evolution, of a completely material world are sickening. The words written of the Old Gods and of the northern giants make it clear that this cannot be possible. As the overmen originated from a land of ice, so much the universe which they inhabit." 
 KAR_work_them_out:0 "Work Them Out"
 KAR_work_them_out_desc:0 "The subverts will pay. The materialists will pay. A new order will be built on the degenerative backs of those who have wronged Karlsland and the Old Gods, and that order will be harmonic and natural."
 KAR_finding_the_giants:0 "Finding the Giants"
 KAR_finding_the_giants_desc:0 "We went north to find the giants of an island in the far north, held by beings of extraordinary stature, immense intelligence, and extreme strength. Instead, we found those people were in front of our noses the whole time - the Karlslander people are those giants!"
 KAR_pilgrimage:0 "A Karlslander Pilgrimage"
 KAR_pilgrimage_desc:0 "Unfortunately, most of what remains of the old Karlslanders is gone. We have no physical traces of the original race, but the late Karlslanders have left inscriptions of the location of holy meadows and trees. Rudel will take a tour of these, both to help Karlslanders rediscover their place in history and to spread the word of the Old Gods."
 KAR_quantum_nonsense:0 "Quantum Nonsense"
 KAR_quantum_nonsense_desc:0 "Quantum theory is being pushed only by scientists who believe in a deity which is not even European, who hold know allegiance to the Karlslander state, and who have decried us at every step of our struggle for power. If only people this subversive could come up with this theory, it itself must be false and will be scrapped."
 KAR_earning_her_name:0 "Earning Her Nickname"
 KAR_earning_her_name_desc:0 "Once nicknamed after the Levantine demon Beelzebub, Rudel is still known for her brutal, effective, and dangerous leadership roles in combat. Subverts will face the same fate her targets have. It will be known that if you stand in the way of the reemergence of the Old Gods and the great Karlslander spirit, you will become just another statistic."
 KAR_karlslander_work_ethic:0 "Karlslander Work Ethic"
 KAR_karlslander_work_ethic_desc:0 "The Karlslander people are some of the hardest working, and some of the most intelligent. We don't need to be spending years in institutions made for inferior peoples - farm and industrial work should be made an option for younger people and should be legal to do longer. We are more industrious, after all."
 KAR_guns_from_the_allfather:0 "Guns from the Allfather"
 KAR_guns_from_the_allfather_desc:0 "The Allfather has blessed our state with modern weaponry! This surely a sign of our revival and of our fate. The great struggle will be difficult, but at least now we know that the Old Gods are on our side."
 KAR_triumph_of_the_will:0 "Triumph of the Will"
 KAR_triumph_of_the_will_desc:0 "Those with the greatest wills will triumph. As we march on to create the new regime, a reflection of the great Old Europe, we must never forget this. Our enemies fight for subversion - only we can bring salvation to Europe and make sure its blood is secure forever."
 KAR_triumph_of_the_will_idea:0 "Triump of the Will"
 KAR_scattered_family:0 "Our Scattered Family"
 KAR_scattered_family_desc:0 "We may be Karlsland in name, but Karlslanders exist all over the face of this earth. Indeed, all of the so called 'Indo-Europeans' are nothing more than lost Karlslanders; separated from their great ancestors after many millennia of broken contact. Our closest family needs to be brought back first, to their rightful homeland - then we can tackle the rest."
 KAR_decry_romagnanism:0 "Decry Romagnanism Everywhere!"
 KAR_decry_romagnanism_desc:0 "Romagnanism is the worst institution to have come from the Apennine Peninsula. A disgusting religion, once the native beliefs of the Romagnans (distorted from the religion of the Old Gods) that was distorted into a formal institution of bureaucracy, degeneracy, and imperialism. We must decry it everywhere it exists - even Romagna, for Romagnanism is not even Romagnan anymore."
 KAR_crusade_for_uppsala:0 "Crusade for Uppsala"
 KAR_crusade_for_uppsala_desc:0 "Baltland holds the keys to the secrets of the Old Gods in their runestones and holy sites. Their current government refuses to allow us full access to their resources, and by standing in the way of a better Europe they must be crushed like the traitors and subverts they are."
 KAR_an_old_map:0 "An Old Map..."
 KAR_an_old_map_desc:0 "An old map shows the dominance of Karlslandic culture has been drastically understated. We used to spread from the north of Italia to far into Orussia and Gallia. Romagna took this from us. The regimes which spread over Europe in every almanac and every modern map descend from this long war against our people. It is time for us to right the wrongs."
 KAR_into_the_low_countries:0 "Into the Low Countries"
 KAR_into_the_low_countries_desc:0 "The Low Countries exist only as a historical anomaly. The Dutch dialect is subversively referred to as a language by its scholars, and Belgica rules in an expoloitation of its unnatural and inorganic borders. Being set in long precedent, these two great political errors can only be resolved through conflict."
 KAR_into_the_low_countries_tooltip:0 "If §Y[GAL.GetNameDef]§! has §Yguaranteed§! or §Ypuppeted§! the §YLow Countries§!, they will be given an event to §Cpotentially relinquish that guarantee§! if it feels it's §Runable or unwilling§! to defend them."
 KAR_break_the_dams:0 "Flood the Dams"
 KAR_break_the_dams_desc:0 "The dams which help form the Netherlands are a testament to their artificiality and falsity as a legitimate nation. The dams will be flooded, and the misdirected Karlslanders will be forced to return; tails between their legs."
 KAR_deprive_the_nobility:0 "Deprive the Nobility"
 KAR_deprive_the_nobility_desc:0 "The debauchery of the Belgican nobility must be condemed in the greatest manner possible. Their land hogging, their cruelty to the lost Karlslanders which resided there, and false regime must be swiftly and totally punished; so that the old Beligcan nobility never sees an easy life again."
 KAR_rip_apart_capital:0 "Rip Apart Their Capital!"
 KAR_rip_apart_capital_desc:0 "The Western Karlslanders were not able to resist temptation. Infamously so, they were the creators of modern capital. For this, it must be seized from them, so that those who deserve that wealth can put it to proper use."
 KAR_gaulish_issue:0 "Solve the Gallian Issue"
 KAR_gaulish_issue_desc:0 "A large number of Gallians resided in southern Belgica, a visible and painful testament to the falsity of the late Belgican state. It's time we banned the use of Gallian within these territories, and shifted the Gallian speaking politicians back to their proper homeland."
 KAR_liberate_gallia_from_the_romagnan_boot:0 "Free Gallia from the \nRomagnan Boot!"
 KAR_liberate_gallia_from_the_romagnan_boot_desc:0 "Despite our historical rivarly, Gallia was ultimately one of the first victims of old Romagnan aggression. Their subsequent states, as with the rest of Europe, have all been slaves to Romagnan hegemony; continously cemented as attempts by the faithful Celts were crushed by despotic Romagnan monarchs and republicans. It's time we freed our Celtic neighbors."
 KAR_crush_the_false_state:0 "Crush the False State"
 KAR_crush_the_false_state_desc:0 "Ostmark is a disgusting and pathetic attempt at bringing out a utopic, functioning state from the unnatural borders of an empire formed from marriage and exploitation of the slavs. The experiment must be crushed, its Karlslanders brought to their home country, and its minorities reminded that 'cooperation' ultimately leads only to subjegation."
 KAR_slavic_fiefdoms:0 "The Slavic Orders"
 KAR_slavic_fiefdoms_desc:0 "Certain groups within the MSKP, including slavic volunteers which have realized that strength resides most within us (and not their liberal state), are deserving of great spoils from the destruction of Ostmark. We will give them two states as prizes for their efforts."
 KAR_carving_out_pannonia:0 "The Pannonian Spoils"
 KAR_carving_out_pannonia_desc:0 "For centuries, the Pannonians collaborated with southern Karlslanders and accepted steppe peoples with open arms. Perhaps no people in late Ostmark require a lesson in strength more than them, so we will force it upon them. Loyal MSKP members will govern its core territories, and we may able to keep Dacia quiet by giving them Transylvania to really send the message."
 KAR_the_baltic_lands:0 "Our Forest Brothers"
 KAR_the_baltic_lands_desc:0 "When Karlsland was most poisoned by Romagnan doctrine, we subjugated and persecuted the Baltic peoples for their native beliefs. A mistake it may have been, but they were still ultimately unable to defend themselves. Their subjegation under the Orussians is a disgusting result of centuries of conflict and our disinterest in taking ownership of that land. It's time we claimed our extended family again."
 KAR_the_degen_trade_repub:0 "The Degenerate\n'Trade Republic'"
 KAR_the_degen_trade_repub_desc:0 "Venezia occupies half of Italia, and controls much of the southern slavs through a long history of exerting strength through their trade routes and participating in true conquest. A valiant struggle indeed; but one which was inspired by a lust for excesses and degeneracy. Ultimately, Europe cannot be fixed while all of Italia remains so backwards."
 KAR_empire_in_the_east:0 "The Dying Empire"
 KAR_empire_in_the_east_desc:0 "Orussia is a dying empire. Despite its attempts to ward off the worst revolutionaries through reform and compromise, its humilating defeat against Fuso demonstrates that the empire has lost its place in the sun. Its lands must be seized by those who deserve it, who will treat the land and its history with reverence and respect."
 KAR_a_border_with_romagna:0 "Our Border with the Romagnans"
 KAR_a_border_with_romagna_desc:0 "It is inevitable that the nation which represents the religion that has subjugated European peoples long past its political roots would come into conflict with us. It is a conflict which screams for a resolution - and with our strength, that will be their defeat."
 KAR_squash_helvetia:0 "Squash the \nMountain Republic"
 KAR_squash_helvetia_desc:0 "Helvetia jumped out of Karlsland's grasp when it was freed in a treaty three-hundered years ago. Though they may hold a distinct taste for neutrality, they are not ultimately that different from the nations which surround them. It's time for Helvetia to come back home."

 KAR_a_materialists_realm:0 "A Materialist's Realm"
 KAR_a_materialists_realm_desc:0 "The national economy, to some extent, is an inherently materialist realm of society. At least, by modern theory. Regardless, we will see to it that the economy makes a solid foundation for Karlsland's new dawn."
 KAR_pursuing_self_sustenance:0 "Pursuing Self Sustenance"
 KAR_pursuing_self_sustenance_desc:0 "Self-sustenance is a practical necessity. With enemies on every single inch of our border, we need to be certain that conflict will not destroy the livelihood of our nation."
 KAR_not_one_out_of_line:0 "Not One Out of Line"
 KAR_not_one_out_of_line_desc:0 "Every corporation, company, and conglomorate in Karlsland needs to walk in lockstep with the MSKP. Anything less is treason, which already has a well defined punishment."
 KAR_schmieden_in_modernity:0 "Schmieden in Modernity"
 KAR_schmieden_in_modernity_desc:0 "The forges of our history brought us our greatest victories. Just like then, we should prepare our forges for the victories in our future. Useless, privately owned, commodity producing factories can easily be repurposed for this manner."
 KAR_clear_magic:0 "Clear Magic"
 KAR_clear_magic_desc:0 "Some of our genuine Karlslander scientists have discovered a way to create mechanical fuels and oils from the rocks we stand upon! This is nothing short of magic, and will come into great use for the struggle which is coming."
 KAR_the_lines_need_more:0 "The Lines Need More!"
 KAR_the_lines_need_more_desc:0 "Many of our production lines require more of the minerals which we already produce. This shouldn't be an issue - we can focus our attention on drawing up more of them so that we are prepared."
 KAR_headfirst_into_alchemy:0 "Headfirst Into Alchemy"
 KAR_headfirst_into_alchemy_desc:0 "Synthesis is, practically, alchemy! Unlike the Romagnans, we have no issue performing such processes. We will produce all of our own fuel, from our own soil!"
 KAR_digging_deeper:0 "Digging Deeper"
 KAR_digging_deeper_desc:0 "We need to dig deeper if we want to fuel our great army. Synthetics are great, but they make easy strategic targets to a planner thinking strategically. We need to use what we have and work with it."
 KAR_to_put_a_smile_on_wiolants_face:0 "To Put a Smile\non Wiolant's Face"
 KAR_to_put_a_smile_on_wiolants_face_desc:0 "Wiolant, the Old God of the forges, must be able to look upon Karlsland and smile with our work. Although eastern Karlsland has been a great military center for centuries, all of Karlsland is booming with beautiful, modern forges."
 KAR_pursuing_self_sustenance_idea:0 "Autarky"
 KAR_synth_boost:0 "Promoted Synthetics Production"

 KAR_new_land_forces:0 "New Land Forces"
 KAR_new_land_forces_desc:0 "Karlsland needs a new heer. Whether that means overhauling the Heer to fit our needs without losing too much experienced officers, or completely replacing it with a hierarchy of regional orders - a favorite of many hardliners and fanatics, we must make a decision."
 KAR_purge_the_heer:0 "Purge the Heer"
 KAR_purge_the_heer_desc:0 "The Heer needs a hearty purge. Most of our highest officers are willing to serve alongside future MSKP fanatics - but many of the old guard in lower ranks are not. Replacing them will take time, but we will lose a lot less experienced men than if we replaced the entire structure of the army."
 KAR_religious_retraining:0 "Religious Unit Retraining"
 KAR_religious_retraining_desc:0 "Existing units, and of course, new units; need to be given special training in the beliefs of the MSKP in regards to the military. This is not a secular or a non-political military anymore, which will be incredibly important for our men to understand."
 KAR_frontline_supremacy:0 "Frontline Supremacy"
 KAR_frontline_supremacy_desc:0 "Nothing is more important, ultimately, than being able to hold a frontline. If the frontline breaks, it becomes impossible to win at all - or even lose with honor."
 KAR_new_hochmeisters:0 "Introduce New Hochmeisters"
 KAR_new_hochmeisters_desc:0 "We can start promoting some of our own through the ranks, now that the new Heer is coming to fruition."

 KAR_unmatchable_speed:0 "Unmatchable Speed"
 KAR_unmatchable_speed_desc:0 "Karlsland will be famous for its use of high speed military technology! We'll pioneer this doctrine like we did the doctrine of u-boats, and with our superior will we will achieve greatness!"
 KAR_magic_through_air:0 "Magic Through Air"
 KAR_magic_through_air_desc:0 "Radio acts like a magic of sorts. Of course, even the inept can understand the basic functions of how the technology works, but it still allows us to accomplish feats of communication not easily done without massive infrastructures before."
 KAR_invest_in_our_seeresses:0 "Invest in our Seeresses"
 KAR_invest_in_our_seeresses_desc:0 "Karlsland has some of the most dedicated, most passionate, and most skilled witches in Europe and the world. We need to invest into them on the land too, since they're essentially excellently powerful light infantry; even if they're most popular in the sky."

 karlsland.552.t:0 "Picking a Shaman"
 karlsland.552.d:0 "Rudel sat at her desk, an unnatural position for her. She would have preferred to be flying, but her personal assistant had forced her - about as close as anyone could say they forced Rudel to do anything - to rest after breaking her right leg again. After thrusting herself to the top of the national council, and immediately disbanding it, Rudel had found normal governance quite boring. She found herself looking out the giant window opposite her desk, thinking that she would have much preferred to be bombing those mechanical aliens from the sky, and not directing funds to pay for the preservation of some grove on the other side of Karlsland.\n\nAnd suddenly, her eyes jumped down to the pen in her hand. She would hire someone to do that boring work for her! Writing plainly, she directed a letter to the entirety of the party staff, declaring her need for a “shaman” to help her on the more “daunting” tasks of connecting to the “spirits of her ancestors”.\n\nA week later, there were three candidates. The first was a relatively well educated man who wore a pair of glasses, which completed his notably academic appearance. His endorsers claim he has been fascinated with the old traditions of Karlsland since (probably) his formative years - and he is by far the most popular choice within the party. Additionally, it says that he would aid greatly in accelerating the national conversion process, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course.\n\nThe second is a renowned occultist who had recently emigrated from Ostmark. He is the most popular among the youth in our party for his eccentric and extensive belief in the power of ice. Though his appearance is not nearly as professional as the other man, his extraordinarily long beard and his obsession with robes makes him a perfect fit for the profession in the Karlslander’s eyes. He claims to have very little administrative experience at all, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course.\n\nThe last candidate is Rudel’s old war partner, Adelheid. Though suspected of going under the guise of “Comrade Leader” and attempting to start a workers uprising, Rudel is fully aware of the slanderous and false nature of this accusation. Though she is not particularly favoured by the party or the public, she undoubtedly complements Rudel well - and is the only one who could provide free milk. Additionally, she seems to have an uncanny knack for organizing groups of people, not that that has anything to do with being a shaman, of course."
 karlsland.552.a:0 "The man with glasses."
 karlsland.552.b:0 "The bearded occultist."
 karlsland.552.c:0 "Adelheid."
 karlsland.553.t:0 "Cleaning Ranks"
 karlsland.553.d:0 "There were still some who wouldn’t follow Rudel. Those who saw the way she fought against the Neuroi years ago and refused to put on their boots and march behind the witch that saved Karlsland. Those who called the traditional Karlslander ways heathenism and hateful. Even those who once sat on the council then claimed Rudel’s autocratic tendencies would lead only to human conflict. Who was allowing them to say these things? To espouse these lies? An inactive party. The party’s forces had to be sharpened up, Rudel decided. They had to hunt out traitors on the ground the same way she hunted alien demons from the sky.\n\nAnd if they wouldn’t start shaping up, then Rudel would have to start cleaning ranks herself."
 karlsland.553.a:0 "Good."
 karlsland.554.t:0 "The Runes Speak"
 karlsland.554.d:0 "After recovering from her broken leg, Rudel immediately began flying - again. Over forests and fields, she caught sight of brass music being played in a small village. She saw as a stubborn clergyman of the Romagnan Church was driven out of his home village and nearly shot in the back.\n\nRudel did occasionally listen to the spiritual drivel pour out from her shaman’s mouth, as they helped her get through the day or write another speech, but she never felt it in herself. The party was always just a way for Rudel to mold Karlsland in her image, without the annoyances of the Kaiser or competing military officials. She was attracted to the marches that inspired her to enlist as a young girl in the first place; the joyful enthusiasm for conflict that she had felt every day when she flew out, which she had thought no one shared. Maybe, she thought, she was a little attracted to the ancient myths of gifted female soldiers who, alone, could ascend to the afterlife alongside men. Or maybe it was just the propaganda.\n\nEither way, when one of those villagers missed the clergyman and hit Rudel’s striker (completely unaware it was her overhead, to be fair) and she landed in front of that stone, she had regretted not listening. The stone - it beckoned to her. It recited, in a language which sounded familiar but which was entirely unintelligible at the same time; poems. They had a pleasant, consistent scheme, which beckoned the leader even closer. Slowly reaching her arm out, crawling, walking across the forest floor; she touched the stone.\n\nAnd it was then that she understood. Understood why she led Karlsland now, why, out of so many other possibledirections, she was the one chosen to lead. It was not just to kill, not just to pursue that ecstasy she felt years ago. It was so much more. She had a duty to Karlslanders, throughout every dimension of time, to restore the greatness of their people and the knowledge that was lost.\n\nAfter dusting herself off, Rudel took a bit of the stone that had broken off for herself."
 karlsland.554.a:0 "Sounds kinda out there to me."
 karlsland.555.t:0 "Neuroi"
 karlsland.555.d:0 "Rudel was sitting on a chair, in a large, empty dining room. An empty plate sat in front of her, but she was staring at a burning fireplace. She didn’t take breaks often, and this one in particular was largely unintentional. She simply sat there, staring.\n\nNo one knew where they came from, but they’d always been there. Terrorising civilizations, evolving to just barely overcome the technological advances of humanity, slaughtering and burning without any purpose or direction at seemingly random intervals throughout history. The Rätsel were implicated in the oldest human myths as monsters and demons; as serpents that encircle the earth or lanky figures that could clear a human village in an hour. But there was never an explanation or a reason. The girl from Fuso learned nothing in making contact with them, negotiations had infamously failed from every attempt in early history to contemporary modernity.\n\nThis had not bothered Rudel. Rudel only cared about the thrill of the fight, of the joy which (literally) shocked her bones as she dove towards the bizarre machines and blew them to pieces. But the runes had a profound effect on her. Why were these unbiological, unearthly things so intent on conquering lands which held seemingly no use or purpose to them?\n\nUnfortunately, Rudel found no answers in herself. A disappointing conclusion indeed, but one which the ancestors appeared to have reached as well, as even her chunk of the runestone fell silent when she went to question it."
 karlsland.555.a:0 "Interesting."


 karlsland.510.t:0 "[KAR.GetNameDef] Offers Us Transylvania"
 karlsland.510.d:0 "[KAR.GetNameDef] has offered us their conquered Transylvania territory in exchange for a non-aggression pact.

However, this could also lower our guard against them in case they decide to bring their warmongering to us."

 karlslandnews.100.d:0 "The churches of Jupiter did not ring their bells in Karlsland today.\n\nThe Reichstag, overrun by HE members and pious members of the outlawed Norse religion, demanded a formal abdication of the monarchy. Seeing no other course of action, with his nation in full (maybe not voluntary) support of the party, the Kaiser's regent had no reasonable choice but to accept. The monarchy's abdication resulted in the immediete implementation of a supreme executive, to be elected only on death, and who would formally head the Norse religion. With power cemented, the first order of the excecutive leader, the brutal witch Hanna Rudel; was to switch the ban on Romagnan religion on its head. Europe trembles with this momentous shift, and what's to come can only be feared."

 KAR_die_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The navy has, historically, not been the forefront of our military interests. That being said, Karlsland never fallen too far behind; so we should make sure our forces can at least put up a fight - and maybe even bring it to the enemy."
 KAR_master_of_the_baltic:0 "Master of the Baltic Sea"
 KAR_master_of_the_baltic_desc:0 "We should look to controlling the Baltic Sea and nearby waters. We don't have industry to pump out massive ships that cost a lot every time they sink, so we need to invest in our smaller u-boats and surface ships."
 KAR_our_western_ports:0 "Looking to our \nWestern Ports"
 KAR_our_western_ports_desc:0 "We already have a significant surface fleet, and our marine engineers are convinced they're onto something on their collaboration with Fuso engineers. We should invest in making a proper, modern, ocean-fairing fleet to compete with other powers again."
 KAR_swamp_of_uboats:0 "A Swamp of U-Boats"
 KAR_swamp_of_uboats_desc:0 "The more u-boats we can pump out, the better. That is, assuming they're modern enough to trick the enemy and scare them just by thinking about getting close to our coastline."
 KAR_improving_destroyer_hulls:0 "Improving Destroyer Hulls"
 KAR_improving_destroyer_hulls_desc:0 "Our destroyers will need to be updated regardless. They're the basis of any navy, so we need to stay on top of them."
 KAR_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation?"
 KAR_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Our engineers are telling us that their Fuso co-engineers have found great use from naval aviation. We should invest in such projects too, so that we can extend our influence even further - as long as the Luftwaffe is ok with it..."
 KAR_improving_our_escorts:0 "Improving our Escort Ships"
 KAR_improving_our_escorts_desc:0 "We still have a lot of large ships in our navy. Since we're still going to use them, of course; we're going to need to make sure our escort ships are up to snuff too."
 KAR_our_arm_in_north_sea:0 "Our Arm in the North Sea"
 KAR_our_arm_in_north_sea_desc:0 "Finally, our engineers have decided that the "carrier" is worth adopting for Karlsland! They've proved extremely useful in Fuso, and with most other European nations not yet implementing the technology, we can gain a massive upperhand in the ocean's skies."
 KAR_pioneer_of_the_doctrine:0 "Pioneer of our Doctrine"
 KAR_pioneer_of_the_doctrine_desc:0 "We are the original pioneers of our small-ship doctrine. Though most other nations base their navies on large ships, relying on large battles to turn the tide of the naval game; we've pioneered a strategy based on small engagements to widdle away the enemy and deny them access - and its proven fairly effective."
 KAR_strategic_invasions:0 "Strategic Invasions"
 KAR_strategic_invasions_desc:0 "There may be situations where we need to send our men overseas to land somewhere to invade - whether it be an island or to break an unmoving front. Our large navy, and our seaborne airforce can support them better than anything else; so let's invest into that."
 KAR_witches_in_the_navy:0 "Witches in the Navy?"
 KAR_witches_in_the_navy_desc:0 "Though most other nations have had witches serve in their navies for decades now, they have always served as part of the Luftwaffe or ground forces, so we've never had a shot at recruiting them ourselves. Now that naval aviation is looking more and more viable, however, it may be a necessity!"

 kwitches.1.t:0 "The First 'Strike Units'"
 kwitches.1.d:0 "Karlslander researches have been hard at work designing new tools to harness the possibilities of our witch population. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled and leg mounted designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. Many of our researches already see great promise in the leg mounted designs.\n\nDespite our great traditions, we have very little witches available to assign these units to. Perhaps expanding our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense, we have one of the largest populations in the world."

############ NOBLE/TROOD EVENTS

 noble.1.t:0 "The Princess"
 noble.1.d:0 "The original heart of Karlsland, Prussia, stands in the hands of the old nobility. Guided by the leadership of a noble witch, whose claims lay outside the political boundaries she's found herself in, the old nobility have used their combined political influence and military prowess to seize what executive institutions still exist.\nPrincess Heinrike has never held an affinity towards commoners. Even in service she struggled to cooperate with her comrades who came from free and personal farms, or a bourgeois private city life. There's nothing that would make her happier than seeing the masses, once serving under the traditional leadership of the nobility, turn away from liberalism and return to their estates. Even if that requires force - a lot of it."
 noble.1.a:0 "Sounds rather depressing..."
 noble.2.t:0 "Council of Nobles"
 noble.2.d:0 "A large group of well dressed Karlslanders were gathered in the Reichstag. It was a largely unorganized gathering, started by Heinrike in order to decide what the goals of the new state would be. The unorganized nature of the meeting, not helped by the youthfulness of many of the nobles, gave rise to more radical discussion. In the end, the group of young nobles had decided that the old Karlslander system was not enough - they wanted to truly assert themselves as the rulers of a new Karlsland, free from any interference to their power above or below:\n\nFears of everything from liberalism, revolution, and fervent religious nationalism were spread throughout the meeting; and the new government was to inherently prevent these strains of thought from ever finding themselves in the minds of the citizenry. The nobility, and the nobility alone, were to decide the fate of their subject estates. The Princess, adressing the group with a smile, said, 'Soon, we will never again have to subjegate our own successes to those unnatural triumphs of the commoner.'"
 noble.2.a:0 "What about the Kaiser?"
 noble.3.t:0 "Extraditing the Kaiser"
 noble.3.d:0 "Kaiser Frederick IV, though still a popular figure to much of the public, was apprehended by supporters of the Noble Council yesterday. Without much hesitation, Heinrike had her former leader sent on a passanger train straight to the Low Countries, where he would be held by Gallian loyalists to prevent any attempts at reasserting his throne. Of course, some Karlslanders weren't pleased with a removal of Frederick IV. Without proper leadership in east Karlsland, however, they're unlikely to pose a well organized threat."
 noble.3.a:0 "Good."
 
 
 noble.50.t:0 "A Deal With the Magocracy"
 noble.50.d:0 "The Magocracy in Saxony, lead by a rapidly assembled council of witches, has not had the time to develop its own sense of patriotic purpose. Many of the more conservative witches see promise in our state, but wish to be more than what they were before the collapse gave them the opportunity. Thus, the idea that we could allow these witches to continue their project in Saxony alone, under our guidance, has become fairly popular within their regime. Though fully integrating Saxony would clearly allow us to truly unify Karlsland again, [Root.GetLeader] finds themselves asking if true unification is actually a goal, or just a means to an end..."
 noble.50.a:0 "...No, this isn't what I had in mind."
 noble.50.b:0 "An interesting project indeed."

 noble.100.t:0 "The Officer"

############# COMRADE LEADER Events
 
 comradeleader.1.t:0 "Comrade Leader!"

############ Magocracy Events

 magocracy.50.t:0 "[KA2.GetNameDef] Proposes A Temporary Alliance"
 magocracy.50.d:0 "[KA2.GetNameDef] has approached our nation with the proposal that, as Karlsland descends into violence, our two states remain peaceful and open to eachother. They have taken a similarly democratic approach to their state, and thus see us as natural allies and companions against the autocratic and radical states on our flanks. However, as we wish to see all of Karlsland placed back into the hands of democracy, we will eventually have to deal with this relationship in a more permanent manner; so it may not be worth it to give them such an advantage."
 magocracy.50.a:0 "We admire the witches' idealism!"
 magocracy.50.b:0 "We will only prevail if we remain focused on the democratic ideal!"
