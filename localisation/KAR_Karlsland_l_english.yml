GAL_1936elections_desc:0 "Gallian elections are held every four years, and have generally remain split between left wing and moderate right wing parties. 1936 is rumored to be a potentially special year for Gallia, with socialist parties and factions having a stronger edge than ever before, even within the broad left-wing Parti socialiste."
GAL_unitedgallia:0 "United Gallia"
GAL_unitedgallia_desc:0 "The Gallian future is one of both prosperity for every Gallian worker, and a state of perpetual war with the Neuroi. The ultimate meaning of being Gallian, from the time of the Romans to the Bonapartes, has been to find freedom in warfare. The Neuroi will come to know Gallia, and our entire populace will be free from the degeneracies of capitalism that we have wrongfull embraced for years."
GAL_workersgallia:0 "Worker's Gallia"
GAL_workersgallia_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent step for the people of both Gallia and the world, but in order to progress into the future we must leave behind one of the most important fascets of our century old ideals - that of capitalistic markets. A more democratic economic system, one in which economic structures are socially owned, will put Gallia again at the head of social progress."

GAL_statusquo_desc:0 "The Third Gallian Republic has been an excellent step for the people of both Gallia and the world, and we see little need to change that.

 kwitches.1.t:0 "The First 'Strike Units'"
 kwitches.1.d:0 "Karlslander researches have been hard at work designing new tools to harness the possibilities of our witch population. As a final culmination of their research, they have produced multiple backpack styled and leg mounted designs which allow witches to fly much in the style of our airplanes. Many of our researches already see great promise in the leg mounted designs.\n\nDespite our great traditions, we have very little witches available to assign these units to. Perhaps expanding our numbers should be the next step in preparing our neuroi defense, we have one of the largest populations in the world."
 kwitches.1.a:0 "Great!"
 KAR_kwitches.10:0 "§YEnroll the first class of 10 witches!"
 
 
 
 karlsland.10.t:0 "The Kaiser Makes His Statement"
 karlsland.10.d:0 "Karlsland, being one of the most powerful nations in the continent of Europe, has a tremendous responsibility to all people which inhabit it. In this reasoning, the leader of Karlsland has decided to act early on the rising trend of right-wing sentiment in his nation seen in nations around Karlsland. Thus, he comes out to announce the support of and strenghthening of: "
 karlsland.10.a:0 "The existing monarchy."
 karlsland.10.b:0 "A more liberal approach, as our neighbors have."
 
 karlsland.20.t:0 "Brittania accepts!"
 karlsland.20.d:0 "Brittania has accepted our request to join the United Nations, expanding our diplomatic outreach extraordinarily."
 karlsland.20.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 karlsland.21.t:0 "Brittania denies!"
 karlsland.21.d:0 "Brittania has denies our request to join the United Nations, publicly shaming us in front of Ostmark. It looks like we'll have to stand alone."
 karlsland.21.a:0 "This is a terrible development..."
 
 karlsland.22.t:0 "Brittania accepts!"
 karlsland.22.d:0 "Brittania has accepted our request for mutual defense, an amazing development for European safety."
 karlsland.22.a:0 "Excellent!"

 karlsland.23.t:0 "Brittania denies!"
 karlsland.23.d:0 "Brittania has denied our request for mutual defense, a bizarre choice; but one we will not soon forget."
 karlsland.23.a:0 "The Empire will not be weakened by this!"
 
 karlsland.30.t:0 "Karsland Invites [Root.GetNameDef] to Their Sphere"
 karlsland.30.d:0 "Karlsland has announced the formation of a new military alliance to sustain stability in peacetime. They have offerred us membership in this alliance, which would mutually strengthen both nations in time of danger." 
 karlsland.30.a:0 "A pact with Karlsland could be immensely useful."
 karlsland.30.b:0 "What business do we have with Karlslanders?"
 
 
 karlsland.50.t:0 "The Fate of the Pagans"
 karlsland.50.d:0 "As the pagans continue to be the primary revolutionary force in Karlsland, the Kaiser has to make his decision on what to do with them and their churches. Many factions of the leading reformed pagan church have become extremely militant as of late, and it'd be possible to incorporate them into the Karlsland military - a dangerous move, but one which would greatly increase the public's support for our military endevours. The HE has made it evident, however, that it would be willing to coup the Kaiser had they enough military support. Perhaps it would be wiser to announce official government support of the churches."
 karlsland.50.a:0 "They'd do great on our front lines."
 karlsland.50.b:0 "Support the churches, but nothing more."
 
 
 karlsland.98.t:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront Marches in Munich"
 karlsland.98.d:0 "In one of the largest public demonstrations held by the pagan ultra-nationalist Heidnische Einheitsfront, the group has shown its numbers and strength to be an undeniable match against our own military. The event ended with over four hours of flame ridden speeches about the degeneracies of the Kaiser's royal friends and the need for change back to the far old days of Karlsland. It seems that a coup - or revolution from the inside - is inevitable."
 karlsland.98.a:0 "A day no Karlslander will forget."

 karlsland.99.t:0 "The Empire 'Lives On'"
 karlsland.99.d:0 "With the Kaiser announcing support for neither party, a large faction has developed out of the Kaiser's supporters calling for his own extreme movement - taking into consideration both the extreme traditionalism of the Heidnische Einheitsfront and the expansionism of the national-socialists, but under the traditional banner of the Kaiser. It would be a regime more powerful than one ever seen on this continent before, and the support is tremendous seeing the new Neuroi."
 karlsland.99.a:0 "How could I say no?"
 
 karlsland.100.t:0 "The Establishment of Parliament"
 karlsland.100.d:0 "In the vital step to actually establishing a liberal government, the Kaiser's cabinet has come to an important decision - whether to have the Kaiser maintain his leading position as an unelected, excecutive monarch; or to have an all encompassing electorate with a subsequently elected ruler. The former would help to contain the popularity of extreme movements, but the latter would come much closer to achieving our goal of a completely liberal government."
 karlsland.100.a:0 "The Kaiser continues his rule."
 karlsland.100.b:0 "Commit to the democratic ideal."
 karlsland.101.t:0 "Pagans and Nationalists Hold National Protests"
 karlsland.101.d:0 "After the announcement of the new parliament, hundereds of Karlslanders took to the public to protest what they see as an even further stagnating government."
 karlsland.101.a:0 "Let's hope they come to see the merit of the parliament."
 
 karlsland.102.t:0 "The Pagans Send An... ultimatum?"
 karlsland.102.d:0 "Only a short time after the wide national rallies, Hanna Rudel, a witch known for speaking on behalf of the Heidnische Einheitsfront, delivered the developing parliament a letter which contained an ultimatum - dissolve the parliament immedietely and replace the Kaiser's cabinet with solely members of the party, or be met with undescribed consenquences."
 karlsland.102.a:0 "Who?"
 karlsland.102.b:0 "Meet them half way and attempt negotiation."
 karlsland.102.c:0 "Fine."
 
 karlsland.103.t:0 "Pagans Storm the Streets!"
 karlsland.103.d:0 "After the Karlsland intermediate government completely failed to recognize the Heidnische Einheitsfront, thousands of militant party supporters have been reported to flood the many cities of Karlsland. It seems collapse is inevitable for the Karlsland republican government."
 karlsland.103.a:0 "And so it is."
 
 karlsland.104.t:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront Declares Wuotanrihhi!"
 karlsland.104.d:0 "Seemingly seconds after party members stormed Karlsland streets, the leading pagan party has declared the official state of the Karlsland nation to be Wuotanrihhi. Finding its support in the western territories of the Karlsland Republic, they declare war on what they see as the heretical and unofficial state of Karlsland now confined to solely the east."
 karlsland.104.a:0 "War it is, then!"
 
 karlsland.110.t:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront Accepts Negotiation"
 karlsland.110.d:0 "After receiving the Karlsland's growing administration's request for negotiation, the Heidnische Einheitsfront immedietely accepted. Whether or not the negotiations will be fruitful has yet to manifest."
 karlsland.110.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 karlsland.120.t:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront Holds Victory Rallies"
 karlsland.120.d:0 "Despite their complete control over the Kaiser's cabinet, the extreme Karlsland nationalists have continued rallying - but in announcement of victory. The end of the Karlslander monarchy has never seemed closer."
 karlsland.120.a:0 "It falls gracefully."
 
 karlsland.121.t:0 "The Kaiser's Cabinent Turns"
 karlsland.121.d:0 "In a move suprising to about no one, the Kaiser's fully pagan-nationalist cabinet has demanded his immediete withdrawl. With the military only partly under his control, and a gun almost literally pointed at his head, the emperor has only one clear choice."
 karlsland.121.a:0 "Give in"
 
 
 karlsland.111.t:0 "Hanna Rudel meets with Helma Lennartz"
 karlsland.111.d:0 "The negotiations between the emerging Karlslander parliament and the Heidnische Einheitsfront are in their final preparatory stages as the witch representatives of both parties meet to relay their respective bargains. Expectations are low on both ends, with the Heidnische Einheitsfront clearly not prepared to cede anything."
 karlsland.111.a:0 "Let's hope it goes smoothly."
 
 karlsland.112.t:0 "Pagans Demand Political Freedom"
 karlsland.112.d:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront makes their first, rather light demand for complete political freedom. This, of course, is in line with what we were imagining, but they would like specific protections for their party as well as other nationalist parties."
 karlsland.112.a:0 "Give them specific protections."
 karlsland.112.b:0 "Ensure that all speech will be protected."
 
 karlsland.113.t:0 "Pagans Demand Integration of their Churches"
 karlsland.113.d:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront makes their second, more significant demand of instituting an official pagan church into the new government. This contradicts entirely our desire for church seperation, but would help maintain national unity."
 karlsland.113.a:0 "Refuse entirely."
 karlsland.113.b:0 "Allow for parliament to declare a state religon."
 karlsland.113.c:0 "Sure!"
 
 karlsland.114.t:0 "Pagans Demand Permanent Seats in Parliament"
 karlsland.114.d:0 "Heidnische Einheitsfront makes what will likely be their final demand - permanent seats in parliament. Demanding half of parliament, they clearly seek to go around their original goal in closer compliance with our government."
 karlsland.114.a:0 "Offer them an eigth."
 karlsland.114.b:0 "Fine."
 
 karlsland.115.t:0 "Secular Nationalists Interrupt Negotiations!"
 karlsland.115.d:0 "In what appeared to be the process of oddly easy negotiations between Pagans and the new Karlslander government, a large group of secular Karlslander nationalists have blocked the exit to the negotiation room. Being heavily armed, guards of the building made no attempt to halt the nationalists in their march.\n\nThey demand to be part of the negotiations, claiming they have just the same rights in the negotiations as the non-secular pagans getting such favorable benefits. Combined, they are just as numerous as the pagans with which we are currently discussing."
 karlsland.115.a:0 "Refuse and deal with them later."
 karlsland.115.b:0 "Give them a seat."
 
 karlsland.118.t:0 "Secular Nationalists Interrupt Negotiations!"
 karlsland.118.d:0 "In what appeared to be the process of oddly easy negotiations between Pagans and the new Karlslander government, a large group of secular Karlslander nationalists have blocked the exit to the negotiation room. Being heavily armed, guards of the building made no attempt to halt the nationalists in their march.\n\nThey demand to be part of the negotiations, claiming they have just the same rights in the negotiations as the non-secular pagans getting such favorable benefits. Combined, they are just as numerous as the pagans with which we are currently discussing; and the pagans are not likely to take our side no matter the situation."
 karlsland.118.a:0 "Give them a seat." 
 
 karlsland.116.t:0 "Nationalist's Immediete Demand"
 karlsland.116.d:0 "Only a day after the nationalists were let into negotiations, the nationalists demand alongside the pagans complete control of parliament - or negotiations would be immedietely halted. The pagans showing a strong attachment to their secular allies and the nationalists already marching in victory, it seems there are only two appropriate responses."
 karlsland.116.a:0 "Fine."
 karlsland.116.b:0 "Never."
 
 karlsland.117.t:0 "Conclusion of Negotiations"
 karlsland.117.d:0 "With the nationalists barred from negotiations, the pagans and the liberal administration has finally reached their so desired compromise. The nationalists will no longer have an ally in revolution, and stability is expected to slowly return to the new and great Republic of Karlsland."
 karlsland.117.a:0 "Amazing!"
 
 karlsland.122.t:0 "The Kaiser Transfers Power"
 karlsland.122.d:0 "After the preceding downfall of Karlsland's parliament and the rise of the nationalists, the Kaiser has fully given in an transferred power to the Heidnische Einheitsfront. With Hanna Rudel as the face of the party, Karlsland heads into the future."
 karlsland.122.a:0 "The end of an era."
 
 
 karlsland.200.t:0 "The State Religion"
 karlsland.200.d:0 "Although we had promised the HE in negotiations that parliament could make a religion, it's painfully clear within the parliament that not one supporter of democracy wishes for one to be established. However, we held an unofficial obligation to pagan groups to establish one. Perhaps a Karlslander Lutheran church could suffice; albeit directly against their founding principles it would be our church. And it's not like anyone would care, considering the type of world we live in."
 karlsland.200.a:0 "No state religion. How is this even a question?"
 karlsland.200.b:0 "A Karlslander Lutheran church!"
 
 
 karlsland.150.t:0 "The First Karlslander Elections"
 karlsland.150.d:0 "With the newly established democratic government of Karlsland, our ultimate step to becoming a legitimate regime should be the first holding of elections. The existing major parties will all be competing for control of parliament, aiming to establish the starting precedent of Karlsland into the future."
 karlsland.150.a:0 "Into the future!"
 
 karlsland.151.t:0 "The Helma and Trude Plans"
 karlsland.151.d:0 "Karlsland's step into democracy has split the largely unified liberal faction into factions based firstly on economic grounds. The progressive social democratic party is pushing strongly for a plan dubbed the 'Helma Economy', named after the young witch headlining the liberal party. Meanwhile, the centrist and right wing parties are hoping for a continuation of the economic policies under the monarchist regime with a stronger emphasis on individual economic ownership; dubbed the 'Trude Economy' for the figurehead of the KKP."
 karlsland.151.a:0 "Helma!"
 karlsland.151.b:0 "Trude!"
 karlsland.151.c:0 "Karlslanders are split - we let parliament decide."
 
 karlsland.152.t:0 "Rhetoric of Diplomacy"
 karlsland.152.d:0 "Karlsland's step into democracy has also raised question about our diplomacy in Europe. The social democrats wish for closer ties with the Entente, seeing their importance to democracy. The liberals continue to wish for closer ties to Ostmark, conservatives wishing instead for continued ties with Ostmark but overall focusing on Karlsland itself."
 karlsland.152.a:0 "Our future is with the Entente."
 karlsland.152.b:0 "We stand with our brothers in the south."
 karlsland.152.c:0 "Ostmark is important - but Karlsland is more."
 
 karlsland.153.t:0 "The Karlsland Election Results"

 karlsland.153.f:0 "Exciting!"
 
 karlsland.300.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Calls for our Annexation"
 karlsland.300.d:0 "Karlsland's leader has made a public statement calling for the annexation of our historical nation. Ignoring our vast and extraordinarily unique history, he has called our nation a historical territory of Karlsland and demands its return. We can obviously deny - we have the backing of Brittania - but this will no doubt give our far-right movements much more courage."
 karlsland.300.a:0 "Deny, of course."
 karlsland.300.b:0 "Maybe they have a point?"
 
 karlsland.304.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Requests a Military Alliance"
 karlsland.304.d:0 "Karlsland has approached our diplomats, asking for a formal military alliance. We'd have little reason to deny, especially seeing the overall lack of human-human violence since long before the first Neuroi war; but our combined technological and military efforts would stand powerfully against any enemy."
 karlsland.304.a:0 "That sounds like an excellent idea!"
 karlsland.304.b:0 "Fuso stands alone."
 
 
 karlsland.310.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Announces Their Support for [Root.GetFascistParty]"
 karlsland.310.d:0 "As if our situation with far-right movements could not get worse, the large power of Karlsland has announced support for [Root.GetFascistParty]. This foreign support can surely not be a good sign for the time to come."
 karlsland.310.a:0 "Let's just hope they don't do anything with it."
 
 karlsland.320.t:0 "Ideological Struggle in the Junta"
 karlsland.320.d:0 "The economic consolidation of Karlsland has lead the three factions to realize their incompability moving forward, seeing that they cannot even agree on the first internal issue of the new state. The three factions, stepping over eachother on every issue, have now seen their conflict come to a head. All three factions have the capability to become popular with the nation's populace, but which faction wins will determine much of the state's future position in the world.\n\nThe NSKAP, secular and focused on national revitalization, would likely see the Karlsland nation turn to notions of greater revanchism.\n\nThe Hyper-Nationalist wing of the NSKAP advocates not only for national revitalization, but a complete integration of the military within the Karlsland state; leading the other factions to consider them unrestricted expansionists.\n\nThe HE advocates for a peaceful consolidation of regional power and a cultural revival at home, but it can sometimes be hard to ignore their outburts of jingoism in reference to the liberal states."
 karlsland.320.a:0 "The NSKAP!"
 karlsland.320.b:0 "The military's NSKAP!"
 karlsland.320.c:0 "The HE!"
